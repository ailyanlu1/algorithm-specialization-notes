1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.635
In this video I'll talk about various
aspects of the course, the topics that

2
00:00:03.635 --> 00:00:07.509
we'll cover, the kinds of skills you can
expect to acquire, the kind of background

3
00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.953
that I expect, the supporting materials
and the available tools for self

4
00:00:10.953 --> 00:00:17.593
assessment. Let's start with the specific
topics that this course is going to cover.

5
00:00:17.593 --> 00:00:21.420
The course material corresponds to the
first half of the ten week Stanford

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.501
course. It's taken by all computer science
undergraduates, as well as many of our

7
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:29.532
graduate students. There will be five high
level topics, and at times these will

8
00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:33.410
overlap. The five topics are first of all,
the vocabulary for reasoning about

9
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.981
algorithm performance, the design and
conquer algorithm design paradigm,

10
00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:40.910
randomization and algorithm design,
primitives for reasoning about graphs, and

11
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.889
the use and implementation of basic data
structures. The goal is to provide an

12
00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:49.130
introduction to and basic literacy in each
of these topics. Much, much more could be

13
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.703
said about each of them, than we'll have
time for here. The first topic is the

14
00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:57.626
shortest, and probably also the driest.
But it's a prerequisite for thinking

15
00:00:57.626 --> 00:01:02.020
seriously about the design and analysis of
algorithms. The key concept here is big-O

16
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.996
notation, which, conceptually, is a
modeling choice about the granularity with

17
00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:10.443
which we measure a performance metric like
the running time of an algorithm. It turns

18
00:01:10.443 --> 00:01:14.628
out that the sweet spot for clear high
level thinking about algorithm design, is

19
00:01:14.628 --> 00:01:18.813
to ignore constant factors and lower-order
terms. And to concentrate on how well

20
00:01:18.813 --> 00:01:23.050
algorithm performance scales with large
input sizes. Big O notation is the way to

21
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.110
mathematize this sweet spot. Now, there's
no one silver bullet in algorithm design.

22
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.630
No single problem solving method that's
guaranteed to unlock all of the

23
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.345
computational problems that you're likely
to face. That said, there are a few

24
00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:39.402
general algorithm design techniques. High
level approaches to algorithm design that

25
00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:43.361
find successful application across a range
of different domains. These relatively

26
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:47.125
widely applicable techniques are the
backbone of a general algorithms course

27
00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:50.890
like this one. In this course, we'll only
have time to deeply explore one such

28
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.899
algorithm design paradigm, namely that of
the divide and conquer algorithms. In the

29
00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.908
sequel course as we'll discuss, there's
two other major algorithms on paradigms to

30
00:01:58.908 --> 00:02:02.526
get covered. But for now, divide and
conquer algorithm, the idea is to first

31
00:02:02.526 --> 00:02:06.388
break the problem into smaller problems
which then gets solved recursively, and

32
00:02:06.388 --> 00:02:10.202
then to somehow quickly combine the
solutions to the sub problems into one for

33
00:02:10.202 --> 00:02:13.966
the original problem that you actually
care about. So for example, in the last

34
00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:17.792
video. We saw two algorithms of this sort,
two divide and conquer algorithms from

35
00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:21.660
multiplying two large integers. In later
videos we will see a number of different

36
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.718
applications. We'll see how to design fast
divide and conquer algorithms for problems

37
00:02:25.718 --> 00:02:29.060
ranging from sorting to matrix
multiplication to nearest neighbor-type

38
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.640
problems and computation of geometry. In
addition, we'll cover some powerful

39
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.460
methods for reasoning about the running
time of recursive algorithms like these.

40
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.247
As for the third topic. A randomized
algorithm is one that, in some sense,

41
00:02:42.247 --> 00:02:46.406
flips coins while it executes. That is, a
randomized algorithm will actually have

42
00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:50.617
different executions if you run it over
and over again on a fixed input. It turns

43
00:02:50.617 --> 00:02:54.984
out, and this is definitely not intuitive,
that allowing randomization internal to an

44
00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:58.831
algorithm, often leads to simple, elegant,
and practical solution to various

45
00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:02.938
computational problems. The canonical
example is randomized quick sort, and that

46
00:03:02.938 --> 00:03:07.045
algorithm and analysis we will cover in
detail in a few lectures. Randomized

47
00:03:07.045 --> 00:03:11.100
primality testing is another killer
application that we'll touch on. And we'll

48
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.026
also discuss a randomized approach to
graph partitioning. And finally

49
00:03:15.026 --> 00:03:20.460
we'll discuss how randomization is used to
reason about hash functions and hash maps.

50
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.000
One of the themes of this course, and one
of the concrete skills that I hope you

51
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.081
take away from the course, is, literacy
with a number of computational primitives

52
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:33.060
for operating on data, that are so fast,
that they're, in some sense, essentially

53
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.988
free. That is, the amount of time it take
to invoke one of these computational

54
00:03:36.988 --> 00:03:41.018
primitives is barely more than the amount
of time you're already spending just

55
00:03:41.018 --> 00:03:45.047
examining or reading the input. When you
have a primitive which is so fast, that

56
00:03:45.047 --> 00:03:49.281
the running time is barely more than what
it takes to read the input, you should be

57
00:03:49.281 --> 00:03:53.430
ready to apply it. For example, in a
preprocessing step, whenever it seems like

58
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.755
it might be helpful. It should just be
there on the shelf waiting to be applied

59
00:03:57.755 --> 00:04:01.971
at will. Sorting is one canonical
example of a very fast, almost for-free

60
00:04:01.971 --> 00:04:06.570
primitive of this form. But there are ones
that operate on more complex data as well.

61
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.895
So recall that a graph is a data structure
that has, on the one hand, vertices, and

62
00:04:10.895 --> 00:04:15.112
on the other hand, edges. Which connects
pair of vertices. Graphs model, among any

63
00:04:15.112 --> 00:04:19.018
other things, different types of networks.
So even though graphs are much more

64
00:04:19.018 --> 00:04:23.292
complicated than mere arrays, there's
still a number of blazingly fast primitives

65
00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:27.356
for reasoning about their structure. In
this class we'll focus on primitives for

66
00:04:27.356 --> 00:04:31.631
competing connectivity information and also shortest paths. We'll also touch on how some primitives have been

67
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:36.227
used to investigate the structure of
information in social networks. Finally,

68
00:04:36.227 --> 00:04:39.572
data structures are often a crucial
ingredient in the design of fast

69
00:04:39.572 --> 00:04:43.692
algorithms. A data structure's responsible
for organizing data in a way that supports

70
00:04:43.692 --> 00:04:47.473
fast queries. Different data structures
support different types of queries. I'll

71
00:04:47.473 --> 00:04:51.350
assume that you're familiar with the
structures that you typically encounter in

72
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.275
a basic programming class including arrays
and vectors. Lists, stacks, and queues.

73
00:04:56.275 --> 00:05:00.502
Hopefully, you've seen at some point both
trees and heaps, or you're willing to read

74
00:05:00.502 --> 00:05:04.577
a bit about them outside of the course,
but we'll also include a brief review of

75
00:05:04.577 --> 00:05:08.600
each of those data structures as we go
along. There's two extremely useful data

76
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.777
structures that we'll discuss in detail.
The first is balanced binary search trees.

77
00:05:12.777 --> 00:05:16.953
These data structures dynamically maintain
an ordering on a set of elements, while

78
00:05:16.953 --> 00:05:21.282
supporting a large number of queries that
run in time logarithmic in the size of

79
00:05:21.282 --> 00:05:25.443
the set. The second data structure we'll
talk a fair bit about is hash tables or

80
00:05:25.443 --> 00:05:29.348
hash maps, which keep track of a dynamic
set, while supporting extremely fast

81
00:05:29.348 --> 00:05:33.203
insert and lookup queries. We'll talk
about some canonical uses of such data

82
00:05:33.203 --> 00:05:37.159
structures, as well as what's going on
under the hood in a typical

83
00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.278
implementation of such a data 
structure. >> There's a number of

84
00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:45.070
important concepts in the design and
analysis of algorithms that we won't have

85
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.765
time to cover in this five week course.
Some of these will be covered in the

86
00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:52.411
sequel course, Design and Analysis of
Algorithms II, which corresponds to the

87
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:56.252
second half of Stanford's ten week course
on this topic. The first part of this

88
00:05:56.252 --> 00:05:59.801
sequel course focuses on two more
algorithm design paradigms. First of

89
00:05:59.801 --> 00:06:03.301
all, the design analysis of greedy
algorithms with applications to minimum

90
00:06:03.301 --> 00:06:06.386
spanning trees, scheduling, and
information theoretic coding. And

91
00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:10.509
secondly, the design analysis of dynamic
programming algorithms with example

92
00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:14.849
applications being in genome sequence
alignment and the shortest path protocols

93
00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.252
in communication networks. The second part
of the sequel course concerns NP complete

94
00:06:19.252 --> 00:06:23.276
problems, and what to do about them. Now,
NP complete problems are problems that,

95
00:06:23.276 --> 00:06:27.352
assuming a famous mathematical conjecture
you might have heard of, which is called the

96
00:06:27.352 --> 00:06:31.273
"P not equal to NP" conjecture, are problems
that cannot be solved under this

97
00:06:31.273 --> 00:06:34.988
conjecture by any computationally
efficient algorithm. We'll discuss the

98
00:06:34.988 --> 00:06:38.806
theory of NP completeness, and, with a
focus on what it means for you as an

99
00:06:38.806 --> 00:06:42.830
algorithm designer. We'll also talk about
several ways to approach NP complete

100
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.700
problems, including: fast algorithms that
correctly solve special cases; fast

101
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.260
heuristics with provable performance
guarantees; and exponential time

102
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.047
algorithms that are qualitatively faster
than brute force search. Of course there

103
00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:58.280
are plenty of important topics that can't
be fit into either of these two five-week

104
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.575
courses. Depending on the demand, there
might well be further courses on more

105
00:07:02.575 --> 00:07:07.623
advanced topics. Following this course is
going to involve a fair amount of time and

106
00:07:07.623 --> 00:07:11.382
effort on your part. So it's only
reasonable to ask: What can you hope to get

107
00:07:11.382 --> 00:07:14.863
out of it? What skills will you learn?
Well. Primarily, you know, even though

108
00:07:14.863 --> 00:07:18.349
this isn't a programming class per se, it
should make you a better programmer.

109
00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:22.107
You'll get lots of practice describing and
reasoning about algorithms, you'll learn

110
00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:25.910
algorithm design paradigms, so really high
level problem-solving strategies that are

111
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.350
relevant for many different problems
across different domains, and tools for

112
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.836
predicting the performance of such
algorithms. You'll learn several extremely

113
00:07:32.836 --> 00:07:36.277
fast subroutines for processing data and
several useful data structures for

114
00:07:36.277 --> 00:07:39.857
organizing data that can be deployed
directly in your own programs. Second,

115
00:07:39.857 --> 00:07:43.868
while this is not a math class per se,
we'll wind up doing a fair amount of

116
00:07:43.868 --> 00:07:48.147
mathematical analysis. And this in turn
will sharpen your mathematical analytical

117
00:07:48.147 --> 00:07:52.372
skills. You might ask, why is mathematics
relevant for a class in the design and

118
00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:56.757
analysis of algorithms, seemingly more of
a programming class. Well let me be clear.

119
00:07:56.757 --> 00:08:00.822
I am totally uninterested in merely
telling you facts or regurgitating code

120
00:08:00.822 --> 00:08:05.261
that you can already find on the web or in
any number of good programming books. My

121
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:09.540
goal here in this class, and the way I
think I can best supplement the resources

122
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:14.484
that you probably already have access
to is to explain why things are

123
00:08:14.484 --> 00:08:18.313
the way they are. Why we analyze the
algorithms in the way that we do, why

124
00:08:18.313 --> 00:08:22.352
various super fast algorithms are in fact
super fast, and so on. And it turns out

125
00:08:22.352 --> 00:08:26.392
that good algorithmic ideas usually
require nontrivial mathematical analysis

126
00:08:26.392 --> 00:08:30.431
to understand properly. You'll acquire
fundamental insights into the specific

127
00:08:30.431 --> 00:08:34.627
algorithms and data structures that we
discuss in the course. And hopefully, many

128
00:08:34.627 --> 00:08:39.912
of these insights will prove useful, more
generally, in your other work. Third, and

129
00:08:39.912 --> 00:08:44.281
perhaps the most relevant for those of you
who work in some other discipline: this

130
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:48.544
course should help you learn how to think
algorithmically. Indeed after studying

131
00:08:48.544 --> 00:08:52.753
algorithms it's hard enough not to see
them pretty much everywhere, whether you

132
00:08:52.753 --> 00:08:57.122
are riding an elevator, watching a flock
of birds, buying and selling stocks out of

133
00:08:57.122 --> 00:09:01.225
your portfolio, even watching an infant
learn. As I said in the previous video

134
00:09:01.225 --> 00:09:05.061
algorithm thinking is becoming
increasingly useful and prevalent if you

135
00:09:05.061 --> 00:09:09.217
are outside of computer science and
technology like in biology, statistics and

136
00:09:09.217 --> 00:09:13.093
economics. Fourth, if you're interested in
feeling like a card carrying computer

137
00:09:13.093 --> 00:09:16.824
scientist, in some sense, then you'll
definitely want basic literacy in all of

138
00:09:16.824 --> 00:09:20.652
the topics that we'll be covering. Indeed,
one of the things that makes studying

139
00:09:20.652 --> 00:09:24.528
algorithms so fun, is, it really feels
like you're studying a lot of the greatest

140
00:09:24.528 --> 00:09:28.308
hits from the last 50 years of computer
science. So, after this class, no longer

141
00:09:28.308 --> 00:09:32.329
will you feel excluded at that computer
science cocktail party when someone cracks

142
00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:35.770
a joke about Dijkstra's Algorithm. Now
you'll know exactly what they mean.

143
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.161
Finally, there's no question that studying
this material is helpful for technical

144
00:09:40.161 --> 00:09:44.553
interview questions. To be clear, my sole
goal here is to teach you algorithms, not

145
00:09:44.553 --> 00:09:49.054
to prepare you for interviews, per se. But
over the years, countless students of mine

146
00:09:49.054 --> 00:09:53.175
have regaled me with stories about how
mastering the concepts in this class

147
00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:57.350
enabled them to ace every technical
question they were ever asked. I told you,

148
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:03.994
this is fundamental stuff. So, what do I
expect from you? Well, honestly, the

149
00:10:03.994 --> 00:10:08.863
answer is nothing. After all isn't the
whole point of a free online class like

150
00:10:08.863 --> 00:10:12.977
this one that anyone can take it and
devote as much effort to it as they like.

151
00:10:12.977 --> 00:10:16.879
So that said, as a teacher it's still
useful to have one or more canonical

152
00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:20.992
students in mind. And I thought I'd go
ahead and be transparent with you about

153
00:10:20.992 --> 00:10:25.263
how I'm thinking about these lectures. Who
I have in mind that I'm teaching to. So

154
00:10:25.263 --> 00:10:29.218
again, please don't feel discouraged if
you don't conform to this canonical

155
00:10:29.218 --> 00:10:33.489
student template. I'm happy to have the
opportunity to teach you about algorithms

156
00:10:33.489 --> 00:10:37.629
no matter who you are. So first, I have in
mind someone who knows at least some

157
00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:41.460
programming. For example, consider the
previous lecture. We talked about a

158
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.663
recursive approach to multiplying two
numbers and I mentioned how in certain

159
00:10:45.663 --> 00:10:49.760
mathematical expression, back then we
labeled it star and circled it in green.

160
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.560
How that expression naturally translated
into a recursive algorithm. In particular,

161
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.407
I was certainly assuming that you had some
familiarity with recursive programs.

162
00:10:57.407 --> 00:11:01.068
If you feel comfortable with my statement
in that lecture, if you feel like you

163
00:11:01.068 --> 00:11:04.637
could code up a recursive integer
multiplication algorithm based on the high

164
00:11:04.637 --> 00:11:08.299
level outline that I gave you, then you
should be in good shape for this course.

165
00:11:08.299 --> 00:11:12.053
You should be good to go. If you weren't
comfortable with that statement, well, you

166
00:11:12.053 --> 00:11:15.576
might not be comfortable with the
relatively high conceptual level at which

167
00:11:15.576 --> 00:11:19.422
we discuss program in this course. But I
encourage to watch the next several videos

168
00:11:19.422 --> 00:11:23.520
anyway, to see if you get enough out of
them to make it worth your while. [sound].

169
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.342
Now, while I'm aiming these lectures at
people who know some programming, I'm not

170
00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:32.505
making any assumptions whatsoever about
exactly which programming languages you know. Any

171
00:11:32.505 --> 00:11:36.459
standard imperative language you know,
something like C, Java or Python, is

172
00:11:36.459 --> 00:11:40.518
totally fine for this course. Now, to make
these lectures accessible to as many

173
00:11:40.518 --> 00:11:44.732
programmers as possible, and to be honest,
you know, also to promote thinking about

174
00:11:44.732 --> 00:11:48.687
programming at a relatively abstract
conceptual level, I won't be describing

175
00:11:48.687 --> 00:11:52.641
algorithms in any particular programming
language. Rather, when I discuss the

176
00:11:52.641 --> 00:11:56.584
algorithms, I'll use only high-level
pseudo-code, or often simply English. My

177
00:11:56.584 --> 00:12:00.377
inductive hypothesis is that you are
capable of translating such a high level

178
00:12:00.377 --> 00:12:04.363
description into a working program in your
favorite programming language. In fact, I

179
00:12:04.363 --> 00:12:08.397
strongly encourage everyone watching these
lectures to do such a translation of all

180
00:12:08.397 --> 00:12:12.047
of the algorithms that we discussed. This
will ensure your comprehension, and

181
00:12:12.047 --> 00:12:15.408
appreciation of them. Indeed, many
professional computer scientists and

182
00:12:15.408 --> 00:12:19.154
programmers don't feel that they really
understand an algorithm until they've

183
00:12:19.154 --> 00:12:22.708
coded it up. Many of the course's
assignments will have a problem in which

184
00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:26.406
we ask you to do precisely this. Put
another way, if you're looking for a sort

185
00:12:26.406 --> 00:12:30.440
of coding cookbook, code that you can copy
and paste directly into your own programs.

186
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.344
Without necessarily understanding how it
works, then this is definitely not the

187
00:12:34.344 --> 00:12:38.050
course for you. There are several books
out there that cater to programmers

188
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:42.043
looking for such coding cook books.
Second, for these lectures I have in mind

189
00:12:42.043 --> 00:12:46.118
someone who has at least a modest amount
of mathematical experience though perhaps

190
00:12:46.118 --> 00:12:49.750
with a fair bit of accumulated rust.
Concretely I expect you to be able to

191
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.488
recognize a logical argument that is a
proof. In addition, two methods of proof

192
00:12:53.488 --> 00:12:57.331
that I hope you've seen before are proofs
by induction and proofs by contradiction.

193
00:12:57.331 --> 00:13:01.129
I also need you to be familiar with basic
mathematical notation, like the standard

194
00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:04.880
quantifier and summation symbols. A few
of the lectures on randomized algorithms

195
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.770
and hashing will go down much easier for
you if you've seen discrete probability

196
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.336
at some point in your life. But beyond
these basics, the lectures will be self

197
00:13:12.336 --> 00:13:15.809
contained. You don't even need to know any
calculus, save for a single simple

198
00:13:15.809 --> 00:13:19.651
integral that magically pops up in the 
analys of the randomized quick sort

199
00:13:19.651 --> 00:13:23.841
algorithm. I imagine that many of you have
studied math in the past, but you could

200
00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:27.654
use a refresher, you're a bit rusty. And
there's plenty of free resources out there

201
00:13:27.654 --> 00:13:31.514
on the web, and I encourage you to explore
and find some that you like. But one that

202
00:13:31.514 --> 00:13:35.002
I want to particularly recommend is a
great set of free lecture notes. It's

203
00:13:35.002 --> 00:13:38.722
called Mathematics for Computer Science.
It's authored by Eric Lehman and Tom

204
00:13:38.722 --> 00:13:42.767
Layden, and it's quite easy to find on the
web if you just do a web search. And those

205
00:13:42.767 --> 00:13:46.580
notes cover all of the prerequisites that
we'll need, in addition to tons of other

206
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:51.822
stuff. In the spirit of keeping this
course as widely accessible as possible,

207
00:13:51.822 --> 00:13:55.734
we're keeping the required supporting
materials to an absolute minimum. Lectures

208
00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:59.793
are meant to be self-contained and we'll
always provide you with the lecture notes

209
00:13:59.793 --> 00:14:03.705
in PowerPoint and PDF format. Once in a
while, we'll also provide some additional

210
00:14:03.705 --> 00:14:07.530
lecture notes. No textbook is required for
this class. But that said, most of the

211
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.588
material that we'll study is well covered
in a number of excellent algorithms books

212
00:14:11.588 --> 00:14:15.308
that are out there. So I'll single out
four such books here. The first three I

213
00:14:15.308 --> 00:14:19.270
mention because they all had a significant
influence on the way that I both think

214
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:23.319
about and teach algorithms. So it's
natural to acknowledge that debt here. One

215
00:14:23.319 --> 00:14:27.668
very cool thing about the second book, the
one by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou and Vazirani, is that the authors

216
00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:32.126
have made a version of it available online
for free. And again, if you search on the

217
00:14:32.126 --> 00:14:36.583
authors' names and the textbook title, you
should have no trouble coming up with it

218
00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:40.933
with a web search. Similarly, that's the
reason I've listed the fourth book because

219
00:14:40.933 --> 00:14:44.799
those authors have likewise made
essentially a complete version of that

220
00:14:44.799 --> 00:14:49.149
book available online and it's a good
match for the material that we're going to

221
00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:52.527
cover here. If you're looking for more
details about something covered in this

222
00:14:52.527 --> 00:14:55.938
class, or simply a different explanation
than the one that I give you, all of these

223
00:14:55.938 --> 00:14:59.225
books are gonna be good resources for you.
There are also a number of excellent

224
00:14:59.225 --> 00:15:02.678
algorithm textbooks that I haven't
put on this list. I encourage to explore

225
00:15:02.678 --> 00:15:06.054
and find you own favorite. >> In our
assignments, we'll sometimes ask you to

226
00:15:06.054 --> 00:15:09.847
code up an algorithm and use it to solve a
concrete problem that is too large to

227
00:15:09.847 --> 00:15:13.313
solve by hand. Now, we don't care what
program and language and development

228
00:15:13.313 --> 00:15:17.153
environment you use to do this as we're
only going to be asking you for the final

229
00:15:17.153 --> 00:15:20.993
answer. Thus, we're not requiring anything
specific, just that you are able to write

230
00:15:20.993 --> 00:15:24.692
and execute programs. If you need help or
advice about how to get set up with a

231
00:15:24.692 --> 00:15:28.438
suitable coding environment, we suggest
that you ask other students for help via

232
00:15:28.438 --> 00:15:32.640
the course discussion forum. Finally,
let's talk a bit more about assessment.

233
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.102
Now this course doesn't have official
grades per se, but we will be assigning

234
00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:39.385
weekly homeworks. Now we're going to
assign homeworks for three different

235
00:15:39.385 --> 00:15:42.398
reasons. The first is just for
self-assessment. It's to give you the

236
00:15:42.398 --> 00:15:46.086
opportunity to test your understanding of
the material so that you can figure out

237
00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:49.735
which topics you've mastered and which
ones that you haven't. The second reason

238
00:15:49.735 --> 00:15:53.458
we do it is to impose some structure on
the course, including deadlines, to

239
00:15:53.458 --> 00:15:57.231
provide you with some additional
motivation to work through all the topics.

240
00:15:57.231 --> 00:16:01.206
Deadlines also have a very important side
effect that synchronizes a lot of the

241
00:16:01.206 --> 00:16:05.281
students in the class. And this of course
makes the course discussion forum a far

242
00:16:05.281 --> 00:16:09.256
more effective tool for students to seek
and provide help in understanding the

243
00:16:09.256 --> 00:16:13.381
course material. The final reason that we
give homeworks is to satisfy those of you

244
00:16:13.381 --> 00:16:16.802
who, on top of learning the course
material, are looking to challenge

245
00:16:16.802 --> 00:16:20.882
yourself intellectually. [sound]. Now,
this class has tens of thousands of

246
00:16:20.882 --> 00:16:24.506
students. So it's obviously essential that
the assignments can be graded

247
00:16:24.506 --> 00:16:28.330
automatically. Now, we're currently only
in the 1.0 generation of free online

248
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.256
courses such as this one. So the available
tools for auto graded assessment are

249
00:16:32.256 --> 00:16:36.231
currently rather primitive. So, we'll do
the best we can, but I have to be honest

250
00:16:36.231 --> 00:16:40.207
with you. It's difficult, or maybe even
impossible to test deep understanding of

251
00:16:40.207 --> 00:16:43.931
the design and analysis of algorithms,
using the current set of tools. Thus,

252
00:16:43.931 --> 00:16:47.928
while the lecture content in this online
course is in no way watered down from the

253
00:16:47.928 --> 00:16:51.700
original Stanford version. The required
assignments and exams we'll give you, are

254
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.614
not as demanding as those that are given
in the on campus version of the course. To

255
00:16:55.614 --> 00:16:59.151
make up for this fact, we'll occasionally
propose optional algorithm design

256
00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:02.594
problems, either in a video or via
supplementary assignment. We don't have

257
00:17:02.594 --> 00:17:06.225
the ability to grade these, but we hope
that you'll find them interesting and

258
00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:09.951
challenging, and that you'll discuss
possible solutions with other students via

259
00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:13.488
the course discussion forum. So I hope
this discussion answered most of the

260
00:17:13.488 --> 00:17:17.402
questions you have about the course. Lets
move on to the real reason that we're all

261
00:17:17.402 --> 00:17:19.100
here, to learn more about algorithms.
