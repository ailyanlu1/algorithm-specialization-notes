1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.974
Alright. So the plan for this video is to
prove the correctness of the divide and

2
00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:07.997
conquer closest to pair algorithm that we
discussed in the previous video. So just

3
00:00:07.997 --> 00:00:12.167
to refresh your memory, how does the outer
algorithm work? Well, we're given endpoints

4
00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:15.699
in the plane. We begin by sorting them,
first by x-coordinate and then by

5
00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.526
y-coordinate. That takes n log in time.
Then we enter the main recursive divide

6
00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:23.539
and conquer part of the algorithm. So what
do we do? We divide the point set into the

7
00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.621
left half and the right half, Q and
R, then we conquer. We recursively compute

8
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:31.546
the closest pair in the left half of the
point set Q. We recursively compute the

9
00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:35.311
closest pair in the right half of the
point set R. There is a lucky case where

10
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:39.199
the closest pair on the entire point set
lies either all on the left or all on the

11
00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.572
right. In that case, the closest pair is
handed to us on a silver platter,

12
00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:46.366
by one of the two recursive calls. But there
remains the unlucky case where the closest

13
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:50.254
pair is actually split with one point on
the left and one point on the right. So to

14
00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:54.002
get our N log N running time bound,
analogous to Merge Short in our inversion

15
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:57.562
counting, we need to have a linear time
implementation of a subroutine which

16
00:00:57.562 --> 00:01:01.122
computes the best, the closest pair of
points, which is split, one on the left

17
00:01:01.122 --> 00:01:04.729
and one on the right. Well, actually, we
don't need to do quite that. We need to

18
00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.870
do something only a little bit weaker. We need
a linear time algorithm, which whenever

19
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.196
the closest pair in the whole point set is
in fact split, then computes that split

20
00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:19.527
pair in linear time. So let me now
remind you of how that subroutine works.

21
00:01:19.527 --> 00:01:23.397
So it has two basic steps. So first,
there's a filtering step. So it looks at,

22
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:27.576
first of all, a vertical strip, roughly
down the middle of the point set. And it

23
00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:31.540
looks at, only at points which fall into
that vertical strip. That was a subset of

24
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.783
the points that we called S sub Y, 'cause
we keep track of them sorted by Y

25
00:01:34.783 --> 00:01:38.711
coordinate. And then we do essentially a
linear scan through SY. So we go through

26
00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:42.601
the points one at a time, and then, for
each point, we look at only the almost

27
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:47.749
adjacent points. So for each index I, we
look only at J's that are between one and

28
00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:52.122
seven positions further to the right, than
I. So among all such points, we

29
00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:56.266
compare them, we look at their distances.
We remember the best such pair of points.

30
00:01:56.266 --> 00:02:00.206
And then that's what we return from the
count split pair subroutine. So we've

31
00:02:00.206 --> 00:02:03.232
already argued, in the previous video,
that the overall running time of the

32
00:02:03.232 --> 00:02:06.408
algorithm is N log N. And what remains to
prove correctness. And we also argued, in

33
00:02:06.408 --> 00:02:11.126
the previous video, that correctness boils
down to the following correctness claim.

34
00:02:11.126 --> 00:02:16.066
In the sense that, if we can prove this
claim, then the entire algorithm is

35
00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:19.905
correct. So this is what remains. Our
residual work is to provide a proof of

36
00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:24.000
the correctness claim. What does it say?
It says consider any split pair that is

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.198
one point p from the left side Q, capital
Q, and another point little q drawn from

38
00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:32.292
the right side of the point set capital R.
And fur, further suppose that it's an

39
00:02:32.292 --> 00:02:36.335
interesting split pair meaning that the
distance between them's at most delta.

40
00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:40.689
Here delta is recall the parameter pass to
the count split pair subroutine, which is

41
00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.494
the smallest distance between a pair of
points all on the left or all on the

42
00:02:44.494 --> 00:02:48.485
right. And this is the only case we're
interested in. There's two claims. First

43
00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:52.661
of all, for p and q, both members of the
split pair survive the filtering step.

44
00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:57.570
They make it into the sorted list S sub Y, and
second of all, they will be considered by

45
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.328
that double for loop, in the sense that
the positions of p and q in this array, S

46
00:03:01.328 --> 00:03:07.001
sub Y, differ by at most seven. So that's
the story so far. Let's move on to the

47
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:13.050
proof. So let's start with part A which is
the easy part relatively of the claim. So

48
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.175
remember what we start with, our
assumptions. We have a point p, let's

49
00:03:17.175 --> 00:03:21.482
write it out in terms of the X
coordinates, X1 and Y1, which is from the

50
00:03:21.482 --> 00:03:26.900
left half of the point set. And we have a
point q, which we'll call X2Y2, which

51
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.914
comes from the right half of the point
set. And furthermore, we're assuming that

52
00:03:30.914 --> 00:03:35.081
these points are close to each other. And
we're gonna use that hypothesis over and

53
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:38.841
over again. So the Euclidean distance
between p and q is no more than this

54
00:03:38.841 --> 00:03:42.754
parameter delta. So, first, something very
simple, which is that if you have two

55
00:03:42.754 --> 00:03:46.565
points that are close in Euclidean
distance, then both of their coordinates

56
00:03:46.565 --> 00:03:50.681
have to be close to each other, right? If
you have two points, and they differ by a

57
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:54.796
lot in one coordinate, then the Euclidean
distance is gonna be pretty big as well.

58
00:03:54.796 --> 00:03:59.182
So, specifically. By our hypothesis, that p
and q have Euclidean distance less than

59
00:03:59.182 --> 00:04:03.369
delta, it must be that the difference
between their coordinates in absolute

60
00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:08.002
value is no more than delta, and as well,
the difference between their y-coordinates

61
00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:12.132
is at most delta. Okay, and this is easy
to see if you'd just return to the

62
00:04:12.132 --> 00:04:16.263
definition of Euclidean distance that we
reviewed at the beginning of the

63
00:04:16.263 --> 00:04:20.340
discussion of closest points. Okay? So if
your distance is at most delta, then in

64
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.860
each coordinate, you differ by at most
delta as well. Now, what does A say?

65
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.763
[sound]. So proof of A. So what does part A
of the claim assert? It asserts that p

66
00:04:29.763 --> 00:04:34.728
and q are both members of SY, are both
members of that vertical strip. So another

67
00:04:34.728 --> 00:04:38.657
way of saying that is that the X
coordinates of p and q, that is, the

68
00:04:38.657 --> 00:04:43.500
numbers X1 and X2 both are within delta of
Xbar. Remember, Xbar was in some sense

69
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.507
the median X coordinate. So the X
coordinate of the N over two'th leftmost

70
00:04:48.507 --> 00:04:52.856
point. So we're gonna do a proof by
picture, so consider, forget about the Y

71
00:04:52.856 --> 00:04:56.690
coordinates, that's of irrelevant right
now, and just focus on the X coordinates

72
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.501
of all of these points. So on the one hand
we have X bar. This is the X coordinate of

73
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:07.477
the N over two'th point to the left. And then
there are the X coordinates which define

74
00:05:07.477 --> 00:05:12.445
the left and the right borders of that
vertical strip. Namely Xbar-delta and

75
00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:17.323
Xbar+delta. And then somewhere in here are
X1 and Y1, the X coordinates of the points

76
00:05:17.323 --> 00:05:21.951
we care about, p and q. So a simple
observation, so because p comes from the

77
00:05:21.951 --> 00:05:26.830
left half of the point set, and Xbar is
the rightmost X coordinate of the left

78
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.641
half of the point set, the X coordinate is
at most Xbar. Right? So all points of Q

79
00:05:31.641 --> 00:05:35.647
have X coordinate, at most, Xbar, in
particular, p does. Similarly, since Xbar

80
00:05:35.647 --> 00:05:40.256
is the rightmost edge of the left half of
the point set, everything in the right half

81
00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:44.316
of the point set has X coordinate, at
least Xbar. So in particular, little q

82
00:05:44.316 --> 00:05:49.059
does as well. So what does this mean. So
this means x1, wherever it is, has to be

83
00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:53.741
at the left of x bar. X2 wherever it is
has to be to the right of x bar. What

84
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:58.600
we're trying to prove is that they're wedged
in between x bar minus delta and x bar

85
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.980
plus delta. And the reason why that's
true is because their x coordinates

86
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.463
also differ by at most delta. Okay, so what
you should imagine is. You can imagine x1

87
00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:11.921
and x2 are sort of people tied by a
rope at the waist. And this rope has

88
00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:16.158
length delta. So wherever x1 and x2
move, they're at most delta apart.

89
00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:20.374
Furthermore x1, we just observed, can't
move any farther to the right than Xbar.

90
00:06:20.374 --> 00:06:25.025
So even if X1 moves as far to the right as
it can, all the way to Xbar, X2, since

91
00:06:25.025 --> 00:06:29.385
it's at most delta away, tied by the
waist, can't extend beyond X bar+ delta. By

92
00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:33.579
the same reasoning, X2 can't move any
further to the left than Xbar, X1 being

93
00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:38.104
tied to the waist to X2, can never drift
further to the left than Xbar minus delta.

94
00:06:38.104 --> 00:06:42.519
So that's the proof that X1 and X2 both
lie within this region, and that defines

95
00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:47.140
the vertical strip. So that's part A. If you
have any split pair whose distance between

96
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.134
them is less than delta, they both have to
wind up, in this vertical strip. And

97
00:06:52.134 --> 00:06:57.690
therefore wind up in the filtered set, the
proof set, S sub Y. So that's part A of

98
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.718
the claim. Let's now move to Part B.
Recall what part B asserts. It says that

99
00:07:02.718 --> 00:07:07.170
the points p and q, this split pair that
are distance only delta apart. Not only do

100
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.677
they wind up in this sort of filtered set
SY, but in fact, they are almost adjacent

101
00:07:11.677 --> 00:07:15.690
in SY, in the sense that the indices in
the array differ by, at most, seven

102
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.474
positions. And this is a part of the claim
that is a little bit shocking. Really what

103
00:07:19.474 --> 00:07:23.081
this says is that we're getting away with
more or less a variant of our one

104
00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:27.300
dimensional algorithm. Remember when we
wanted to find the closest pair of points

105
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.415
on the line, all we had to do was sort
them by their single coordinate and then

106
00:07:31.415 --> 00:07:35.538
look at consecutive pairs and return the
best of those consecutive pairs. Here what

107
00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:39.109
we're saying is really, once we do a
suitable filtering focus on points in this

108
00:07:39.109 --> 00:07:43.499
vertical strip, then we just go through
the points according to their Y

109
00:07:43.499 --> 00:07:47.103
coordinate. And okay, we don't just look
at adjacent pairs. We look at pairs within

110
00:07:47.103 --> 00:07:51.990
seven positions, but still we basically do
a linear sweep through the points in SY.

111
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.434
According to their Y coordinate and that's
sufficient to identify the closest split

112
00:07:56.434 --> 00:08:00.917
pair. So why on earth will this be true.
So our workhorse in this argument will be

113
00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:05.059
a picture which I am going to draw on
next. So I'm going to draw eight boxes,

114
00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:09.406
which have a height and width delta over
two. So here, delta is the same parameter

115
00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:13.595
that gets passed to the closest split
pair subroutine. And it's also the same

116
00:08:13.595 --> 00:08:17.518
delta which we're assuming p and q are
closer to each other than, right? So

117
00:08:17.518 --> 00:08:21.335
that's, remember, that's one of our
hypotheses in this claim. The distance

118
00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:25.364
between p and q is strictly less than
delta. So we're gonna draw eight delta

119
00:08:25.364 --> 00:08:31.476
over two boxes. And they're gonna be
centered at x bar. So, this same center of

120
00:08:31.476 --> 00:08:37.862
the vertical strip that defines S Y. And
the bottom is going to be the smaller of the

121
00:08:37.862 --> 00:08:42.627
Y-coordinates of the points p and q.
So it might be p, it might be q. It

122
00:08:42.627 --> 00:08:47.995
doesn't really matter. But the bottom
is going to be the smaller of the two. So

123
00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:53.219
the picture then looks as follows. So the
center of these collections of eight

124
00:08:53.219 --> 00:09:01.125
boxes, X bar, the bottom is the minimum of
Y1, Y2. We're gonna have two rows and four

125
00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:07.158
columns. And needless to say, we're
drawing this picture just for the sake of

126
00:09:07.158 --> 00:09:10.726
this correctness proof, right? This
picture is just a thought experiment in

127
00:09:10.726 --> 00:09:14.402
our head. We're just trying to understand
why the algorithm works. The algorithm, of

128
00:09:14.402 --> 00:09:18.102
course, does not draw these boxes. The
subroutine, the, closest split pair

129
00:09:18.102 --> 00:09:22.007
subroutine is just that pseudo code we saw
in the previous video. This is just to

130
00:09:22.007 --> 00:09:25.527
reason about the behavior of that
subroutine. Now looking ahead, I'll make

131
00:09:25.527 --> 00:09:29.480
this precise in two lemmas that are
about to come up, what's going to be true

132
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.987
is the following. So, either p or q is on
this bottom line, right? So we define the

133
00:09:33.987 --> 00:09:38.435
bottom to be the lower Y coordinate of the
two. So maybe, for example, q is the one

134
00:09:38.435 --> 00:09:42.766
that has the smaller Y coordinate, in
which case, is gonna be, somewhere, say,

135
00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:47.389
down here. P, you remember, is from the
left half of the point sets. So p is maybe

136
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:51.078
gonna be here or something. And we're
gonna argue that both p and q have to be

137
00:09:51.078 --> 00:09:54.506
in these boxes. Moreover, we're gonna
argue that these boxes are sparsely

138
00:09:54.506 --> 00:10:00.940
populated. Every one contains either zero
or one point of the array S sub Y. So,

139
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.738
what we're gonna see is that there's at
most eight points in this picture, two of

140
00:10:04.738 --> 00:10:08.113
which are p and q, and therefore, if you
look at these points sorted by Y

141
00:10:08.113 --> 00:10:11.817
coordinate, it has to be that they're
within seven of each other, the difference

142
00:10:11.817 --> 00:10:17.460
of indices is no more than seven.
So, we're gonna make those two statements

143
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:23.835
precise one at a time by the following two
lemmas. Let's start with lemma one. Lemma

144
00:10:23.835 --> 00:10:28.412
one is the easy one. And it states that
all of the points of S sub Y, which show up

145
00:10:28.412 --> 00:10:33.102
in between the Y coordinates of the points
we care about p and q have to appear in

146
00:10:33.102 --> 00:10:38.952
this picture, they have to lie in one of
these eight boxes. So we're going to argue

147
00:10:38.952 --> 00:10:42.910
this in two steps. First, we're going to
argue that all such points have to have Y

148
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.014
coordinates within the relevant range of
this picture between the minimum of Y1 and

149
00:10:47.014 --> 00:10:50.971
Y2 and delta more than that, and secondly
that they have to have X coordinates in

150
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:57.525
the range of this picture, namely between X
bar minus delta and X bar plus delta. So

151
00:10:57.525 --> 00:11:01.247
let's start with Y coordinates. So again,
remember this key hypothesis we have,

152
00:11:01.247 --> 00:11:05.163
okay. We're dealing with a split pair p-q
that are close to each other. The distance

153
00:11:05.163 --> 00:11:08.934
between X and Y is strictly less than
delta. So the very first thing we did at

154
00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:12.801
the beginning of this proof is we said
well, if their Euclidean distance is less

155
00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:16.766
than delta then they have to differ by at
most delta in both of their coordinates,

156
00:11:16.766 --> 00:11:23.294
in particular in their Y coordinate.
Now remember whichever is lower of p and

157
00:11:23.294 --> 00:11:27.736
q, whichever one has a smaller y
coordinate is precisely at the bottom of

158
00:11:27.736 --> 00:11:32.785
this diagram. For example, if q is the one
with the smaller y coordinate, it might be

159
00:11:32.785 --> 00:11:37.732
on the black line right here. So that
means in particular x has y coordinate no

160
00:11:37.732 --> 00:11:41.973
more than the top part of this diagram. No
more than delta bigger than q. And of

161
00:11:41.973 --> 00:11:46.376
course all points with Y coordinates in
between them are equally well wedged into

162
00:11:46.376 --> 00:11:50.886
this picture. So that's why all points of
SY with a Y coordinate between those of p

163
00:11:50.886 --> 00:11:54.913
and q have to be in the range of this
picture, between the minimum of the two Y

164
00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:59.315
coordinates and delta more than that. Now
what about horizontally? What about the X

165
00:11:59.315 --> 00:12:05.438
coordinates? Well this just follows from
the definition of S sub Y. So remember,

166
00:12:05.438 --> 00:12:08.775
S sub Y are the points that fall into this
vertical strip. How did we define the

167
00:12:08.775 --> 00:12:12.486
vertical strip? Well it had center Xbar,
and then we fattened it by delta on both

168
00:12:12.486 --> 00:12:17.402
sides. So just by definition, if you're an
SY, you've gotta have X coordinates in the

169
00:12:17.402 --> 00:12:23.882
range of this picture. X delta plus minus,
sorry, xbar plus minus delta. So that

170
00:12:23.882 --> 00:12:27.607
completes the proof of the lemma. So this is
not. This is just a lemma. So I'll use a

171
00:12:27.607 --> 00:12:31.476
lower case qed. Remember this is
just a step toward proving the overall

172
00:12:31.476 --> 00:12:35.106
correctness claim. But this is a good
step. And again, the way you think about

173
00:12:35.106 --> 00:12:38.880
this is it says we draw this boxes. We
know that either p or q is at the bottom.

174
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.144
The other one is going to be on the other
side of the black line x bar but will be

175
00:12:43.144 --> 00:12:47.356
in some other box so perhaps maybe p is
here and the lemma is saying that all the

176
00:12:47.356 --> 00:12:51.415
relevant points of SY have to be somewhere
in this picture. Now remember in our

177
00:12:51.415 --> 00:12:55.319
double for loop we only search seven
positions away, so the concern is that

178
00:12:55.319 --> 00:12:59.378
this is a sorta super highly populated
collection of eight boxes. That's the

179
00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:03.539
concern, but that's not going to be the
case and that's exactly what lemma two is

180
00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:07.694
going to say. Not only do the points
between p and q in Y coordinates show up

181
00:13:07.694 --> 00:13:11.965
in this diagram, but there have to be very
few. In particular, every box has to be

182
00:13:11.965 --> 00:13:18.810
sparse, with population either zero or one.
So, let's move on to lemma two. So formally

183
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:24.776
the claim is [sound], we have at most one
point of the point set in each of these

184
00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:30.572
eight boxes. And this is finally where we
use, in a real way, the definition of

185
00:13:30.572 --> 00:13:35.697
delta. This is where we finally get the
payoff from our realization long ago, that

186
00:13:35.697 --> 00:13:40.379
when defining the closest split pair
subroutine, we only really need to be

187
00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:45.504
correct in the unlucky case. In the case
we're not handed the right answer by one

188
00:13:45.504 --> 00:13:50.629
of our recursive calls. We're finally
gonna use that fact in a fundamental way.

189
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:56.756
So we're gonna proceed by contradiction.
So we're going to think about what happens

190
00:13:56.756 --> 00:14:01.159
if there are two points in a single box
and from that we'll be able to derive a

191
00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:08.202
contradiction. So, call the points that
wind up in the same box A and B. So, to

192
00:14:08.202 --> 00:14:16.168
the contrary, suppose A and B lie in the
same box. So, maybe this is A here, and

193
00:14:16.168 --> 00:14:23.627
this is B here, at antipodal corners of
this particular box. So from this

194
00:14:23.627 --> 00:14:31.125
supposition, we have two consequences.
First of all. I claim that A and B lie on

195
00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:36.057
the same side of the point set. They're
either both in the left side, Q or they're

196
00:14:36.057 --> 00:14:41.595
both in the right side, R. So why is this
true? Well it's because every box lies either

197
00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:46.116
entirely on the left half of the point set
or on the right half of the point

198
00:14:46.116 --> 00:14:51.375
set. Recall how we define x bar. X bar is
the x coordinate of the right most point

199
00:14:51.375 --> 00:14:56.693
amongst the left half of the point set
capital Q. So therefore points with x

200
00:14:56.693 --> 00:15:01.354
coordinate at most x bar have to lie
inside the left half Q. Points with x

201
00:15:01.354 --> 00:15:05.574
coordinates at least x bar have to
lie inside the right half of the point

202
00:15:05.574 --> 00:15:09.513
set capital R. So that would be like in
this example. A and b both lie in a box

203
00:15:09.513 --> 00:15:13.238
which is to the right of x bar. So they
both have to come in the right half

204
00:15:13.238 --> 00:15:17.490
of the point set capital R. This is one
place we are using that there are no ties

205
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.375
in X coordinate, so if there's a point
with X, X coordinate or X bar, we can

206
00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:25.491
count it as part of the left half. So
every box, by virtue of being either to

207
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:30.155
the left of xbar or to the right of xbar,
can only contain points from a common half

208
00:15:30.155 --> 00:15:34.064
of the point set. So that's the first
consequence of assuming that you have two

209
00:15:34.064 --> 00:15:37.468
points in the same box. The second
consequence is, because the boxes are

210
00:15:37.468 --> 00:15:43.904
small, the points gotta be close. So, if A
and B co-habitate a box, how far could

211
00:15:43.904 --> 00:15:47.651
they be from each other? Well, the
farthest they could be is like I've drawn

212
00:15:47.651 --> 00:15:50.667
in the picture, with the points A and B.
Where they're at opposite corners of a

213
00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:54.164
common box. And then you bust out
Pythagorean's Theorem, and what do you

214
00:15:54.164 --> 00:15:58.661
get? You get that the distance between
them is delta over two, the side of the

215
00:15:58.661 --> 00:16:03.790
box times root two. And what's relevant
for us is this is strictly less than

216
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:10.300
delta. Okay? But, now, here is where we
use, finally, the definition of delta.

217
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.983
Consequences one and two in tandem,
contradict how we define delta. Remember

218
00:16:14.983 --> 00:16:19.953
what delta is. It's as close as two pair
of, a pair of points can get if they both

219
00:16:19.953 --> 00:16:24.044
lie on the left side of the point set, or
if they both lie on the right side of the

220
00:16:24.044 --> 00:16:27.313
point set. That is how we defined it. As
small as a pair of points on a common half

221
00:16:27.313 --> 00:16:31.553
can get to each other. But what have we
just done? We've exhibited a pair A and B

222
00:16:31.553 --> 00:16:35.687
that lie on the same half of the point
set, and are strictly closer than delta.

223
00:16:35.687 --> 00:16:40.335
So that contradicts the definition of
delta. So that completes the proof of lemma

224
00:16:40.335 --> 00:16:44.196
two. Let me just make sure we're all clear
on why having proved lemma one and lemma two

225
00:16:44.196 --> 00:16:47.875
we're done with the proof part B of the
claim and therefore the entire claim

226
00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:51.556
because we already proved
part one, now a long time ago.

227
00:16:51.556 --> 00:16:56.558
So let's interpret the 2 lemmas in
the context of our picture that we had all

228
00:16:56.558 --> 00:17:00.227
throughout. In terms of the eight boxes of
side length delta over two by

229
00:17:00.227 --> 00:17:05.680
delta over two. So again, whichever is the
lower of p and q, and again let's just for

230
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.340
the sake of concreteness say it's q, is at
the bottom of the picture. The other point

231
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:15.053
is on the other half of the line Xbar, and
is in one of the other boxes. So, for

232
00:17:15.053 --> 00:17:20.323
example, maybe p is right here. So lemma
one says that every relevant point, every

233
00:17:20.323 --> 00:17:25.188
point that survives the filtering and
makes it into SY, by virtue of being in

234
00:17:25.188 --> 00:17:29.856
the vertical strip, has to be in one of
those boxes, okay? If it has Y coordinate

235
00:17:29.856 --> 00:17:36.102
in between p and q. Lemma two says that
you can only have one point in each of these boxes

236
00:17:36.102 --> 00:17:40.821
from the point set, so that's gonna be at
most eight total. [sound] So combining

237
00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:48.436
them. Lemmas one and two imply, that there
are almost eight points in this picture

238
00:17:48.436 --> 00:17:55.638
and that includes p and q because they
also occupy two of eight boxes. So in the

239
00:17:55.638 --> 00:18:00.390
worst case, if this is as densely
populated as could possibly be, given

240
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:05.576
lemmas one and two, every other box might
have a point and perhaps every one of

241
00:18:05.576 --> 00:18:10.042
those points has a Y coordinate between p
and q. But this is as bad as it gets.

242
00:18:10.042 --> 00:18:14.655
Any point of the strip with Y
coordinate between p and q occupies a box.

243
00:18:14.655 --> 00:18:19.087
So, at most, there are these six wedged in
between them. What does this mean? This

244
00:18:19.087 --> 00:18:22.703
means if from q you look seven
positions ahead in the array, you are

245
00:18:22.703 --> 00:18:27.903
guaranteed to find this point p. So a
split pair with distance less than delta

246
00:18:27.903 --> 00:18:33.242
is guaranteed to be identified by our
double for loop. Looking seven positions

247
00:18:33.242 --> 00:18:39.288
ahead in the sorted array SY is sufficient
to identify, to look at every conceivably

248
00:18:39.288 --> 00:18:45.442
interesting split pair. So that completes
the assertion B of the correctness

249
00:18:45.442 --> 00:18:49.461
claim and we're done. That
establishes that this supremely clever

250
00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:54.672
divide and conquer algorithm is indeed
a correct O(nlog(n)) algorithm that computes the

251
00:18:54.672 --> 00:18:58.000
closest pair of a set of n points in the
plane.
