00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.045
The goal of this video is to provide more
details about the implementation of the

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:08.085
QuickSort algorithm and, in particular,
if you're ever going to drill down on the

3
00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:13.008
key Partition subroutine, just let me
remind you what the job of the Partition

4
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:17.036
subroutine is in the context of sorting an
array. So recall that key idea in QuickSort

5
00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:21.021
is to partition the input array around a
pivot element. So this has two steps.

6
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:25.046
First, you somehow choose a pivot element,
and in this video, we're not going to worry

7
00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:29.046
about how you choose the pivot element.
For concreteness, you might just want to

8
00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:33.045
think about you pick the first element
in the array to serve as

9
00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:37.050
your pivot. So in this example array, the
first element happens to be 3, so we

10
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.045
can choose 3 as the pivot element.
Now, there's a key rearrangement step. So

11
00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:45.070
you rearrange the array so that it has the
following properties. Any entries

12
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.075
that are to the left of the pivot element
should be less than the pivot element.

13
00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:53.014
Whereas any entries, which are to the
right of the pivot element, should be

14
00:00:53.014 --> 00:00:56.075
greater than the pivot element. So, for
example, in this, version of, the second

15
00:00:56.075 --> 00:01:00.024
version of the array, we see to the left
of the 3 is the 2 and the 1.

16
00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:04.000
They're in reverse order, but that's okay.
Both the 2 and the 1 are to the left

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.071
of the 3, and they're both less than 3.
And the five elements to the right

18
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:11.028
of the 3, they're jumbled up, but
they're all bigger than the pivot element.

19
00:01:11.028 --> 00:01:14.090
So, this is a legitimate rearrangement
that satisfies the partitioning property.

20
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.043
And, again, recall that this definitely
makes partial progress toward having a

21
00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:21.096
sorted array. The pivot element winds up
in its rightful position. It winds up

22
00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:25.085
where it's supposed to be in the final
sorted array, to the right of everything

23
00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:30.006
less than it, to the left of everything
bigger than it. Moreover, we've correctly

24
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:34.027
bucketed the other N-1 elements to
the left and to the right of the pivot

25
00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:38.069
according to where they should wind up in
the final sorted array. So that's the job,

26
00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.064
that the Partition subroutine is
responsible for. Now what's cool is we'll

27
00:01:42.064 --> 00:01:46.024
be able to implement this Partition
subroutine in linear time. Even better,

28
00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:50.004
we'll be able to implement it so that all
it does, really, is swaps in the array.

29
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:53.056
That is, it works in-place. It needs no
additional, essentially constant

30
00:01:53.056 --> 00:01:57.056
additional memory, to rearrange the array
according to those properties. And then,

31
00:01:57.056 --> 00:02:01.065
as we saw on the high-level description of
the QuickSort algorithm, what partitioning

32
00:02:01.065 --> 00:02:05.036
does is, it enables a divide-and-conquer
approach. It reduces the problem size.

33
00:02:05.036 --> 00:02:09.036
After you've partitioned the array around
the pivot, all you gotta do is recurse on

34
00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:13.021
the left side, recurse on the right side,
and you're done. So, what I owe you is

35
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:17.054
this implementation. How do you actually
satisfy the partitioning property, stuff

36
00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:21.076
to the left of the pivot is smaller than
it, stuff to the right of the pivot is

37
00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:25.092
bigger than it, in linear time, and in-
place. Well, first, let's observe that, if

38
00:02:25.092 --> 00:02:29.081
we didn't care about the in-place
requirement, if we were happy to just

39
00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:34.020
allocate a second array and copy stuff
over, it would actually be pretty easy to

40
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.077
implement a Partition subroutine in
linear time. That is, using O(N) extra

41
00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:43.082
memory, it's easy to partition around a
pivot element in O(N) time. And as

42
00:02:43.082 --> 00:02:48.007
usual, you know, probably I should be more precise
and write theta of N, are used in cases that would

43
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:52.027
be the more accurate stronger statement,
but I'm going to be sloppy and I'm just

44
00:02:52.027 --> 00:02:56.031
going to write the weaker but still
correct statement, using Big-Oh, okay? So

45
00:02:56.031 --> 00:03:00.046
O(N) time using linear extra memory.
So how would you do this? Well let

46
00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:04.056
me just sort of illustrate by example. I
think you'll get the idea. So let's go

47
00:03:04.056 --> 00:03:12.017
back to our running example of an input
array. Well, if we're allowed to use

48
00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:16.036
linear extra space, we can just
preallocate another array of length N.

49
00:03:18.018 --> 00:03:22.017
Then we can just do a simple scan through
the input array, bucketing elements

50
00:03:22.017 --> 00:03:25.096
according to whether they are bigger than
or less than the pivot. And, so for

51
00:03:25.096 --> 00:03:29.080
example, we can fill in the additional
array both from the left and the right,

52
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.090
using elements that are less than or
bigger than the pivot respectively. So for

53
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.089
example we start with the 8, we know
that the 8 is bigger than the pivot,

54
00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:41.093
so you put that at the end of the output
array. Then we get to the 2. The 2 is

55
00:03:41.093 --> 00:03:45.093
less than the pivot, so that should go on
the left hand side of the output array.

56
00:03:45.093 --> 00:03:50.075
When you get to the 5, it should go on the
right-hand side, and the 1 should go on

57
00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:57.009
the left-hand side, and so on. When we
complete our scan through the input array,

58
00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:01.017
there'll be one hole left, and that's
exactly where the pivot belongs, to the

59
00:04:01.017 --> 00:04:05.045
right of everything less than it, to the
left of everything bigger than it. So,

60
00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:09.068
what's really interesting, then, is to
have an implementation of Partition, which

61
00:04:09.068 --> 00:04:13.087
is not merely linear time, but also uses
essentially no additional space. It

62
00:04:13.087 --> 00:04:17.062
doesn't re-sort to this cop-out of
pre-allocating an extra array of

63
00:04:17.062 --> 00:04:21.063
length N. So, let's turn to how that
works. First, starting at a high-level,

64
00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:27.050
then filling in the details. So I'm
gonna describe the Partition subroutine

65
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.095
only for the case where the pivot is in
fact the first element. But really this is

66
00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:38.005
without loss of generality. If, instead,
you want to use some pivot from the middle

67
00:04:38.005 --> 00:04:41.074
of the array, you can just have a
preprocessing step that swaps the first

68
00:04:41.074 --> 00:04:46.003
element of the array with the given pivot,
and then run the subroutine that I'm about

69
00:04:46.003 --> 00:04:50.012
to describe, okay. So with constant time
preprocessing, the case of a general pivot

70
00:04:50.012 --> 00:04:56.089
reduces to the case of when the pivot is
the first element. So here's the high-level

71
00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:01.021
idea, and it's very cool. The idea is,
we're gonna be able to able to get

72
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:10.022
away with just a single linear scan of the
input array. So in any given moment in

73
00:05:10.022 --> 00:05:14.016
this scan, there's just gonna be a single
for-Loop, we'll be keeping track of both

74
00:05:14.016 --> 00:05:18.019
the part of the array we've looked at so
far, and the part that we haven't looked at

75
00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:21.079
so far. So there's gonna be two groups,
what we've seen, what we haven't seen.

76
00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:25.073
Then within the group we've seen, we're
gonna have definitely split further, according

77
00:05:25.073 --> 00:05:29.057
to the elements that are less than the
pivot and those that are bigger than the

78
00:05:29.057 --> 00:05:35.006
pivot. So we're gonna leave the pivot
element just hanging out in the first

79
00:05:35.006 --> 00:05:38.078
element of the array until the very end of
the algorithm, when we correct its

80
00:05:38.078 --> 00:05:44.030
position with a swap. And at any given
snapshot of this algorithm, we will have

81
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.091
some stuff that we've already looked at,
and some stuff that we haven't yet looked

82
00:05:50.091 --> 00:05:56.060
at in our linear scan. Of course, we have
no idea what's up with the elements that

83
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.038
we haven't looked at yet, who knows
what they are, and whether they're bigger

84
00:06:00.038 --> 00:06:03.097
or less than the pivot. But, we're gonna
implement the algorithm, so, among the

85
00:06:03.097 --> 00:06:07.051
stuff that we've already seen, it will be
partitioned, in the sense that all

86
00:06:07.051 --> 00:06:11.029
elements less than the pivot come first,
all elements bigger than the pivot come

87
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:15.002
last. And, as usual, we don't care about
the relative order, amongst elements less

88
00:06:15.002 --> 00:06:20.016
than the pivot, or amongst elements bigger
than the pivot. So summarizing, we do a

89
00:06:20.016 --> 00:06:25.063
single scan through the input array. And
the trick will be to maintain the

90
00:06:25.063 --> 00:06:29.083
following invariant throughout the linear
scan. But basically, everything we have

91
00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:33.093
looked at the input array is partitioned.
Everything less than the pivot comes

92
00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:37.097
before everything bigger than the pivot.
And, we wanna maintain that invariant,

93
00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:41.081
doing only constant work, and no
additional storage, with each step of our

94
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:47.081
linear scan.
So, here's what I'm gonna do next. I'm

95
00:06:47.081 --> 00:06:51.067
gonna go through an example, and execute
the Partition subroutine on a concrete

96
00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:55.044
array, the same input array we've been
using as an example, thus far. Now, maybe

97
00:06:55.044 --> 00:06:59.030
it seems weird to give an example before
I've actually given you the algorithm,

98
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.027
before I've given you the code. But, doing
it this way, I think you'll see the gist

99
00:07:03.027 --> 00:07:06.099
of what's going on in the example, and
then when I present the code, it'll be

100
00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:10.085
very clear what's going on. Whereas, if I
presented the code first, it may seem a

101
00:07:10.085 --> 00:07:14.042
little opaque when I first show you the
algorithm. So, let's start with an

102
00:07:14.042 --> 00:07:21.016
example. Throughout the example, we wanna
keep in mind the high-level picture that

103
00:07:21.016 --> 00:07:25.079
we discussed in the previous slide. The
goal is that, at any time in the Partition

104
00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:30.018
subroutine, we've got the pivot hanging
out in the first entry. Then, we've got

105
00:07:30.018 --> 00:07:34.075
stuff that we haven't looked at. So, of
course, who knows whether

106
00:07:34.075 --> 00:07:39.015
those elements are bigger than or less
than the pivot? And then, for the stuff

107
00:07:39.015 --> 00:07:43.060
we've looked at so far, everything less
than the pivot comes before everything

108
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:48.011
bigger than the pivot. This is the picture
we wanna retain, as we go through the

109
00:07:48.011 --> 00:07:53.014
linear scan. As this high-level picture
would suggest, there is two boundaries

110
00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:57.064
that we're gonna need to keep track of
throughout the algorithm. We're gonna need

111
00:07:57.064 --> 00:08:01.098
to keep track of the boundary between what
we've looked at so far, and what we

112
00:08:01.098 --> 00:08:06.059
haven't looked at yet. So, that's going to
be, we're going to use the index  "j" to keep

113
00:08:06.059 --> 00:08:10.098
track of that boundary. And then, we also
need a second boundary, for amongst the

114
00:08:10.098 --> 00:08:15.037
stuff that we've seen, where is the split
between those less than the pivot and

115
00:08:15.037 --> 00:08:19.048
those bigger than the pivot. So, that's
gonna be "i". So, let's use our running

116
00:08:19.048 --> 00:08:26.004
example array. >> So stuff is pretty
simple when we're starting out. We haven't

117
00:08:26.004 --> 00:08:32.008
looked at anything. So all of this stuff
is unpartitioned. And "i" and  "j" both point

118
00:08:32.008 --> 00:08:38.049
to the boundary between the pivot and all
the stuff that we haven't seen yet. Now to

119
00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:42.017
get a running time reaches linear, we
want to make sure that at each step we

120
00:08:42.017 --> 00:08:46.000
advance  "j", we look at one new element.
That way in a linear number of steps, we'll

121
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.097
have looked at everything, and hopefully
we'll be done, and we'll have a partitioned

122
00:08:49.097 --> 00:08:55.035
array. So, in the next step, we're going to
advance  "j". So the region of the array

123
00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:59.054
which is, which we haven't looked at,
which is unpartitioned, is one smaller

124
00:08:59.054 --> 00:09:03.086
than before. We've now looked at the
8, the first element after the pivot.

125
00:09:04.094 --> 00:09:08.073
Now the 8 itself is indeed a
partitioned array. Everything less than

126
00:09:08.073 --> 00:09:13.000
the pivot comes before, everything after
the pivot turns out there's nothing less

127
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.007
than the pivot. So vacuously this is
indeed partitioned. So  "j" records

128
00:09:17.007 --> 00:09:21.079
delineates the boundary between what we've
looked at and what we haven't looked at, "i"

129
00:09:21.079 --> 00:09:26.018
delineates amongst the stuff we've looked
at, where is the boundary between what's

130
00:09:26.018 --> 00:09:30.031
bigger than and what's less than the
pivot. So the 8 is bigger than the pivot,

131
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:35.014
so "i" should be right here. Okay, because we
want "i" to be just to the left of all the

132
00:09:35.014 --> 00:09:39.098
stuff bigger than the pivot. Now, what's
gonna happen in the next iteration? This

133
00:09:39.098 --> 00:09:44.095
is where things get interesting. Suppose
we advance  "j" one further. Now the part of

134
00:09:44.095 --> 00:09:49.054
the array that we've seen is an 8
followed by a 2. Now an 8 and a 2

135
00:09:49.054 --> 00:09:53.023
is not a partitioned subarray. Remember
what it means to be a partitioned

136
00:09:53.023 --> 00:09:57.021
subarray? All the stuff less
than the pivot, all the stuff less than

137
00:09:57.021 --> 00:10:01.010
3, should come before everything
bigger than 3. So (8, 2) obviously

138
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:05.023
fails that property. 2 is less than the
pivot, but it comes after the 8, which

139
00:10:05.023 --> 00:10:09.012
is bigger than the pivot. So, to correct
this, we're going to need to do a swap.

140
00:10:09.012 --> 00:10:15.060
We're going to swap the 2 and the 8.
That gives us the following version of the

141
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:21.088
original array. So now the stuff that we
have not yet looked at is one smaller than

142
00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:28.084
before. We've advanced  "j". So all other
stuff is unpartitioned. Who knows what's

143
00:10:28.084 --> 00:10:34.001
going on with that stuff?  "j" is one further
entry to the right than it was before, and

144
00:10:34.001 --> 00:10:39.081
at least after we have done this swap, we
do indeed have a partitioned array. So

145
00:10:39.081 --> 00:10:43.098
post-swap, the 2 and the 8, are
indeed partitioned. Now remember, "I"

146
00:10:43.098 --> 00:10:48.062
delineates the boundary between amongst
what we've seen so far, the stuff less

147
00:10:48.062 --> 00:10:53.032
than the pivot, less than 3 in this
case, and that bigger than 3, so "I" is

148
00:10:53.032 --> 00:10:59.060
going to be wedged in between the 2 and
the 8. In the next iteration, our life

149
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:04.076
is pretty easy. So, in this case, in
advancing  "j", we uncover an element which

150
00:11:04.076 --> 00:11:08.087
is bigger than the pivot. So, this is what
happened in the first iteration, when we

151
00:11:08.087 --> 00:11:12.098
uncovered the 8. It's different than
what happened in the last iteration when

152
00:11:12.098 --> 00:11:16.083
we uncovered the 2. And so, this case,
this third iteration is gonna be more

153
00:11:16.083 --> 00:11:20.088
similar to the first iteration than the
second iteration. In particular, we won't

154
00:11:20.088 --> 00:11:24.074
need to swap. We won't need to advance "i".
We just advance  "j", and we're done. So,

155
00:11:24.074 --> 00:11:30.024
let's see why that's true. So, we've
advanced  "j". We've done one more iteration.

156
00:11:30.024 --> 00:11:35.006
So, now the stuff we haven't seen yet is
only the last four elements. So, who knows

157
00:11:35.006 --> 00:11:40.010
what's up with, the stuff we haven't seen
yet? But if you look at the stuff we have

158
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.050
seen, the 2, the 8, and the 5,
this is, in fact, partitioned, right? All

159
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:48.089
the numbers that are bigger than 3
succeed, come after, all the numbers

160
00:11:48.089 --> 00:11:54.096
smaller than three. So the "j",
the boundary between what we've seen and

161
00:11:54.096 --> 00:11:58.094
what we haven't is between the 5 and
the 1; and the "i", the boundary between

162
00:11:58.094 --> 00:12:03.028
the stuff less than the pivot and bigger
than the pivot is between the 2 and the

163
00:12:03.028 --> 00:12:10.005
8, just like it was before. Adding a
5 to the end didn't change anything. So

164
00:12:10.005 --> 00:12:16.063
let's wrap up this example in the next
slide. So first, let's just remember where

165
00:12:16.063 --> 00:12:20.069
we left off from the previous slide. So
I'm just gonna redraw that same step after

166
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:28.080
three iterations of the algorithm. And
notice, in the next generation, we're going

167
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:33.046
to, again, have to make some modifications
to the array, if we want preserve our

168
00:12:33.046 --> 00:12:37.069
variant. The reason is that when we
advance  "j", when we scan this 1, now

169
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:42.023
again we're scanning in a new element
which is less than the pivot, and what

170
00:12:42.023 --> 00:12:46.050
that means is that, the partitioned
region, or the region that we've looked at

171
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:50.036
so far, will not be partitioned. We'll
have 2851. Remember we need everything

172
00:12:50.036 --> 00:12:54.022
less than 3 to precede everything
bigger than 3, and this 1

173
00:12:54.022 --> 00:12:58.038
at end is not going to cut it. So we're
going to have to make a swap. Now what are

174
00:12:58.038 --> 00:13:05.077
we going to swap? We're going to swap the
1 and the 8. So, why do we swap the

175
00:13:05.077 --> 00:13:10.033
1 and the 8? Well, clearly, we have
to swap the 1 with something. And, what

176
00:13:10.033 --> 00:13:14.078
makes sense? What makes sense is the
left-most array entry, which is currently

177
00:13:14.078 --> 00:13:19.000
bigger than the pivot. And, that's exactly
the 8. Okay, that's the first,

178
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.074
left-most entry bigger than 3, so if
we swap the 1 with it, then the 1 will

179
00:13:23.074 --> 00:13:29.092
become the right-most entry smaller than
3. So after the swap, we're gonna have

180
00:13:29.092 --> 00:13:36.037
the following array. The stuff we haven't
seen is the 4, the 7, and the 6.

181
00:13:37.087 --> 00:13:44.048
So the  "j" will be between the 8 and the
4. The stuff we have seen is the 2,

182
00:13:44.048 --> 00:13:49.057
1, 5, and 8. And notice, that
this is indeed partitioned. All the

183
00:13:49.057 --> 00:13:53.033
elements, which are less than 3, the
2 and the 1, precede all of the

184
00:13:53.033 --> 00:13:57.003
entries, which are bigger than 3, the
5 and the 8. "i", remember, is

185
00:13:57.003 --> 00:14:00.094
supposed to split, be the boundary
between those less than 3 and those

186
00:14:00.094 --> 00:14:04.094
bigger than 3. So, that's gonna lie
between the 1 and the 5. That is one

187
00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:11.017
further to the right than it was in the
previous iteration. Okay, so the, because

188
00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:15.050
the rest of the unseen elements, the 4,
the 7, and the 6, are all bigger

189
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:20.000
than the pivot, the last three iterations
are easy. No further swaps are necessary.

190
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.073
No increments to "i" are necessary.  "j" is just
going to get incremented until we fall off

191
00:14:24.073 --> 00:14:29.017
the array. And then, fast forwarding, the
Partition subroutine, or this main linear

192
00:14:29.017 --> 00:14:35.047
scan, will terminate with the following
situation. So at this point, all of the

193
00:14:35.047 --> 00:14:40.047
elements have been seen, all the elements
are partitioned.  "j" in effect has fallen

194
00:14:40.047 --> 00:14:45.041
off the end of the array, and "i", the boundary
between those less than and bigger than

195
00:14:45.041 --> 00:14:50.085
the pivot, still lies between the 1 and
the 5. Now, we're not quite done,

196
00:14:50.085 --> 00:14:54.080
because the pivot element 3 is not in
the correct place. Remember, what we're

197
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.067
aiming for is an array where everything
less than the pivot is to the left of it,

198
00:14:58.067 --> 00:15:02.062
and everything bigger than the pivot is to
the right. But right now, the pivot still

199
00:15:02.062 --> 00:15:06.053
is hanging out in the first element. So,
we just have to swap that into the correct

200
00:15:06.053 --> 00:15:10.020
place. Where's the correct place? Well,
it's going to be the right-most element,

201
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:16.051
which is smaller than the pivot. So, in
this case, the 1. So the subroutine will

202
00:15:16.051 --> 00:15:20.099
terminate with the following array,
12358476. And, indeed, as desired,

203
00:15:20.099 --> 00:15:26.056
everything to the left of the pivot
is less than the pivot, and everything to

204
00:15:26.056 --> 00:15:31.099
the right of the pivot is bigger than the
pivot. The 1 and 2 happen to be in

205
00:15:31.099 --> 00:15:37.008
sorted order, but that was just sorta an
accident. And the 4, 5, 6 and

206
00:15:37.008 --> 00:15:44.087
7 and 8, you'll notice, are jumbled
up. They're not in sorted order. So

207
00:15:44.087 --> 00:15:49.044
hopefully from this example you have a
gist of how the Partition subroutine is

208
00:15:49.044 --> 00:15:53.084
going to work in general. But, just to
make sure the details are clear, let me

209
00:15:53.084 --> 00:16:01.005
now describe the pseudocode for the
Partition subroutine. So the way I'm going

210
00:16:01.005 --> 00:16:05.051
to denote it is, there's going to be an
input array A. But rather than being told

211
00:16:05.051 --> 00:16:09.081
some explicit link, what's going to be
passed to the subroutine are two array

212
00:16:09.081 --> 00:16:13.077
indices. The leftmost index, which
delineates this part of the separator

213
00:16:13.077 --> 00:16:20.017
you're supposed to work on, and the
rightmost index. The reason I'm writing it

214
00:16:20.017 --> 00:16:24.078
this way is because Partition is going to
be called recursively from within a QuickSort

215
00:16:24.078 --> 00:16:28.097
algorithm. So any point in QuickSort,
we're going to be recursing on some

216
00:16:28.097 --> 00:16:33.021
subset, contiguous subset of the original
input array. "l(el)" and "r" meant to denote

217
00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:39.070
what the left boundary and the right
boundary of that subarray are. So, let's

218
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:44.001
not lose sight of the high-level picture
of the invariant that the algorithm is

219
00:16:44.001 --> 00:16:48.015
meant to maintain. So, as we discussed,
we're assuming the pivot element is the

220
00:16:48.015 --> 00:16:52.030
first element, although that's really
without loss of generality. At any given

221
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:56.050
time, there's gonna be stuff we haven't
seen yet. Who knows what's up with that?

222
00:16:56.050 --> 00:17:00.091
And, amongst the stuff we've seen, we're
gonna maintain the invariant that all the

223
00:17:00.091 --> 00:17:05.049
stuff less than the pivot comes before all
the stuff bigger than the pivot. And  "j" and

224
00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:09.069
I denote the boundaries, between the seen
and the unseen, and between the small

225
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:15.012
elements and the large elements,
respectively. So back to the pseudocode,

226
00:17:15.012 --> 00:17:20.041
we initialize the pivot to be the first
entry in the array. And again remember, l

227
00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:26.091
denotes the leftmost index that we're
responsible for looking at. Initial value

228
00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:32.021
of "i", should be just to the right of the
pivot so that's gonna be el+1.

229
00:17:32.021 --> 00:17:40.015
That's also the initial value of  "j", which
will be assigned in the main for-Loop. So this

230
00:17:40.015 --> 00:17:46.074
for-Loop with "j", taking on all values from
el+1 to the rightmost index "r",

231
00:17:46.074 --> 00:17:55.001
denotes the linear scan through the input array. And,
what we saw in the example is that there

232
00:17:55.001 --> 00:17:58.062
were two cases, depending on, for the
newly seen element, whether it's bigger

233
00:17:58.062 --> 00:18:02.050
than the pivot, or less than the pivot.
The easy case is when it's bigger than the

234
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:06.025
pivot. Then we essentially don't have to
do anything. Remember, we didn't do any

235
00:18:06.025 --> 00:18:10.009
swaps, we didn't change "i", the boundary
didn't change. It was when the new element

236
00:18:10.009 --> 00:18:16.076
was less than the pivot that we had to do
some work. So, we're gonna check that, is

237
00:18:16.076 --> 00:18:26.086
the newly seen element, A[j], less than "p".
And if it's not, we actually don't have to do

238
00:18:26.086 --> 00:18:35.040
anything. So let me just put as a
comment. If the new element is bigger than

239
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:40.095
the pivot, we do nothing. Of course at the
end of the for-Loop, the value of  "j" will

240
00:18:40.095 --> 00:18:44.084
get in command so that's the only thing
that changes from iteration to iteration,

241
00:18:44.084 --> 00:18:48.073
when we're sucking up new elements that
happen to be bigger than "p". So what do we

242
00:18:48.073 --> 00:18:52.063
do in the example, when we suck up our new
element less than p? Well we have to do

243
00:18:52.063 --> 00:19:01.000
two things. So, in the event that the
newly seen element is less than "p", I'll

244
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.024
circle that here in pink. We need to do a
rearrangement, so we, again, have a

245
00:19:06.024 --> 00:19:11.084
partitioned, sub-array amongst those
elements we've seen so far. And, the best

246
00:19:11.084 --> 00:19:17.079
way to do that is to swap this new element
with the left-most element that's bigger

247
00:19:17.079 --> 00:19:24.031
than the pivot. And because we have an
index "i", which is keeping track of the

248
00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:28.079
boundary between the elements less than
the pivot and bigger than the pivot, we can

249
00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:33.022
immediately access the leftmost element
bigger than the pivot.

250
00:19:33.022 --> 00:19:39.023
That's just the "i"th
entry in the array. Now I am

251
00:19:39.023 --> 00:19:43.098
doing something a little sneaky here,
I should be honest about. Which is there is

252
00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:48.056
the case where you haven't yet seen any
elements bigger than the pivot, and then

253
00:19:48.056 --> 00:19:52.087
you don't actually have a leftmost
element bigger than the pivot to swap

254
00:19:52.087 --> 00:19:56.082
with. Turns out this code still works,
I'll let you verify that, but it does do

255
00:19:56.082 --> 00:20:01.002
some redundant swaps. Really, you don't
need to do any swaps until you first see

256
00:20:01.002 --> 00:20:04.088
some elements bigger than the pivot, and
then see some elements less than the

257
00:20:04.088 --> 00:20:08.036
pivot. So, you can imagine a different
limitation of this, where you

258
00:20:08.036 --> 00:20:11.080
actually keep track of whether or not
that's happened to avoid the redundant

259
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.097
swaps. I'm just gonna give you the
simple pseudocode. And again, for

260
00:20:14.097 --> 00:20:18.063
intuition, you wanna think about the case
just like, in the picture here in blue,

261
00:20:18.063 --> 00:20:22.011
where we've already seen some elements
that are bigger than the pivot, and the

262
00:20:22.011 --> 00:20:25.077
next newly seen element is less than the
pivot. That's really sort of the key case

263
00:20:25.077 --> 00:20:31.048
here. Now the other thing we have to do
after one of these swaps is, now the

264
00:20:31.048 --> 00:20:35.060
boundary, between where the array elements
less than the pivot and

265
00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.073
those bigger than the pivot, has moved.
It's moved one to the right, so

266
00:20:39.073 --> 00:20:45.029
we have to increment "i". So, that's the
main linear scan. Once this concludes,  "j"

267
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:49.093
will have fallen off the end of the array.
And, everything that we've seen the final

268
00:20:50.009 --> 00:20:54.025
elements, except for the pivot, will be
arranged so that those less than "p" are

269
00:20:54.025 --> 00:20:58.067
first, those bigger than "p" will be last.
The final thing we have to do is just swap

270
00:20:58.067 --> 00:21:03.009
the pivot into its rightful position. And,
recall for that, we just swap it with the

271
00:21:03.009 --> 00:21:10.027
right-most element less than it. So, that
is it. That is the Partition subroutine.

272
00:21:10.027 --> 00:21:14.055
There's a number of variants of partition.
This is certainly not the unique

273
00:21:14.055 --> 00:21:18.093
implementation. If you look on the web, or
if you look in certain textbooks, you'll

274
00:21:18.093 --> 00:21:23.021
find some other implementations as well as
discussion of the various merits. But, I

275
00:21:23.021 --> 00:21:27.018
hope this gives you, I mean, this is a
canonical implementation, and I hope it

276
00:21:27.018 --> 00:21:31.025
gives you a clear picture of how you
rearrange the array using in-place swaps

277
00:21:31.025 --> 00:21:35.042
to get the desired property, that all the
stuff before the pivot comes first, all

278
00:21:35.042 --> 00:21:41.048
the stuff after the pivot comes last.
Let me just add a few details about why

279
00:21:41.048 --> 00:21:46.069
this pseudocode I just gave you does,
indeed, have the properties required. The

280
00:21:46.069 --> 00:21:52.016
running time is O(N), really theta of N,
but again, I'll be sloppy and write

281
00:21:52.016 --> 00:21:57.030
O(N). Where N is the number of array
elements that we have to look at. So, N is

282
00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:02.037
r-el+1, which is the length of
the sub-array that this Partition

283
00:22:02.037 --> 00:22:08.002
subroutine is invoked upon. And why is
this true? Well if you just go inspect the

284
00:22:08.002 --> 00:22:12.024
pseudocode, you can just count it up
naively and you'll find that this is true.

285
00:22:12.024 --> 00:22:16.066
We just do a linear scan through the array
and all we do is basically a comparison

286
00:22:16.066 --> 00:22:22.064
and possibly a swap and an increment for
each array entry that we see. Also, if you

287
00:22:22.064 --> 00:22:27.006
inspect the code, it is evident that it
works in-place. We do not allocate some

288
00:22:27.006 --> 00:22:31.026
second copy of an array to populate, like
we did in the naive Partition

289
00:22:31.026 --> 00:22:36.083
subroutine. All we do is repeated swaps.
Correctness of the subroutine follows by

290
00:22:36.083 --> 00:22:41.060
induction, so in particular the best way
to argue it is by invariant. So I'll state

291
00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:45.092
the invariant here, but mostly leave it
for you to check that indeed, every

292
00:22:45.092 --> 00:22:51.071
iteration of the for-Loop maintains this
invariant. So first of all, all of the

293
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:56.072
stuff to the right of the pivot element,
to the right of the leftmost entry and up

294
00:22:56.072 --> 00:23:01.002
to the index "i", is indeed less than the
pivot element, as suggested by the

295
00:23:01.002 --> 00:23:07.027
picture. And also suggested by the
picture, everything beginning with the "i"th

296
00:23:07.027 --> 00:23:13.018
entry, leading just up before the "j"th entry,
is bigger than the pivot. And I'll

297
00:23:13.018 --> 00:23:17.068
leave it as a good exercise for you to
check that this holds by induction.

298
00:23:18.064 --> 00:23:23.013
The invariant holds initially,
when both "i" and  "j" are equal to el+1,

299
00:23:23.013 --> 00:23:27.002
because both of these sets are vacuous, okay?
So, there are no such elements, so they're

300
00:23:27.002 --> 00:23:30.072
trivially satisfied these properties. And
then, every time we advance  "j", well, in

301
00:23:30.072 --> 00:23:34.037
one case it's very easy, where the new
element is bigger than the pivot. It's

302
00:23:34.037 --> 00:23:38.012
clear that, if the invariant held before,
it also holds at, at the next iteration.

303
00:23:38.012 --> 00:23:42.001
And then, if you think about it carefully,
this swap in this increment of "i" that we

304
00:23:42.001 --> 00:23:46.012
do, in the case where the new element is
less than the pivot. After the swap, once

305
00:23:46.012 --> 00:23:50.099
the fold is complete, again if this
invariant was true at the beginning of it,

306
00:23:50.099 --> 00:23:55.080
it's also true at the end. So what good is
that? Well, by this claim, at the

307
00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:00.068
conclusion of the linear scan at which
point "j" has fallen off the end of the

308
00:24:00.068 --> 00:24:06.048
array, the array must look like this. At
the end of the for-Loop, the question

309
00:24:06.048 --> 00:24:10.052
mark part of the array has vanished, so
everything other than the pivot has been

310
00:24:10.052 --> 00:24:14.071
organized so that all this stuff less than
the pivot comes before everything after

311
00:24:14.071 --> 00:24:18.054
the pivot, and that means once you do the
final swap, once you swap the pivot

312
00:24:18.054 --> 00:24:22.053
element from its first and left most
entry, with the right most entry less than

313
00:24:22.053 --> 00:24:26.046
the pivot, you're done. Okay? You've got
the desired property that everything to

314
00:24:26.046 --> 00:24:30.045
the left of the pivot is less than, and
everything to the right of the pivot is

315
00:24:30.045 --> 00:24:35.099
bigger than. So now that given a pivot
element we understand how to very quickly

316
00:24:35.099 --> 00:24:40.031
rearrange the array so that it's
partitioned around that pivot element,

317
00:24:40.031 --> 00:24:45.012
let's move on to understanding how that
pivot element should be chosen and how,

318
00:24:45.012 --> 00:24:49.081
given suitable choices of that pivot
element, we can implement the QuickSort

319
00:24:49.081 --> 00:24:54.050
algorithm, to run very quickly, in
particular, on average in O(N) log time.
