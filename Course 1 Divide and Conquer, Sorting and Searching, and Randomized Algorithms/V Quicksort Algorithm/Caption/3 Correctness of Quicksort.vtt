1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.636
I just got the number of divide and
conquer algorithms and, so far, I've been

2
00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:07.464
short shrift to proofs of correctness.
This has been a conscience decision on my

3
00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:11.291
part. Coming up with the right divide and
conquer algorithm for a problem can

4
00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:15.310
definitely be difficult, but once you have
that eureka moment and you figure out the

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.090
right algorithm you tend to, also, have a
good understanding of why it's correct,

6
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.726
why it actually solves the problem on
every possible input. Similarly when I

7
00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:26.028
present to you a divide and conquer
algorithm like, say, merge sort or

8
00:00:26.028 --> 00:00:29.903
quicksort, I expect that many of you have
a good and accurate intuition about why

9
00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:33.548
the algorithm is correct. In contrast the
running time of these developed

10
00:00:33.548 --> 00:00:37.360
[inaudible] algorithms is often highly
non-obvious. So, correctness proofs for

11
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.132
divide-and-conquer algorithms tend to
simply formalize the intuition that you

12
00:00:41.132 --> 00:00:44.997
have via a proof by induction. That's why
I haven't been spending much time on them.

13
00:00:44.997 --> 00:00:48.816
But nevertheless, I do feel like I owe you
at least one rigorous correctness proof

14
00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:52.542
for a divide-and-conquer algorithm, and we
may as well do it for quicksort. So in

15
00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:56.314
this optional video, we'll briefly review
proofs by induction, and then we'll show

16
00:00:56.314 --> 00:01:00.272
how such a proof can be used to rigorously
establish the correctness of quicksort.

17
00:01:00.272 --> 00:01:03.997
The correctness proofs for most of the
other divide-and-conquer algorithms that

18
00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:10.741
we discuss can be formalized in a similar
way. So let's begin by reviewing the

19
00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:15.868
format for proofs by induction. So, the
canonical proofs by induction and the kind

20
00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:21.246
that we'll be using here, is when you want
to establish an assertion for all of the

21
00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:25.934
positive integers in. So now it's some
assertion which is parameterized by n,

22
00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:30.520
where n is a positive integer. I know this
is a little abstract, so let me just be

23
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:40.446
concrete about the assertion that we
actually care about for quicksort. So for

24
00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:45.941
us, the assertion P(n) is the statement
that cor, quicksort is always correct on

25
00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:56.726
inputs of length n, arrays that have n
elements. So an induction proof has two

26
00:01:56.726 --> 00:02:10.993
parts. The first part is a base case and
the second part is an inductive step. For

27
00:02:10.993 --> 00:02:15.157
the base case you have to get started so
you show that at the very least your

28
00:02:15.157 --> 00:02:23.673
assertion is true when n equals one. This
is often a trivial matter and that'll be

29
00:02:23.673 --> 00:02:28.769
the case when we establish the correctness
of quick sort. Just on our rays with only

30
00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.161
one element. So, the non-trivial part of a
proof by induction is usually the

31
00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:40.508
inductive step. And in the inductive step,
you look at a value of n not covered by

32
00:02:40.508 --> 00:02:45.084
the base case, so a value of n bigger than
one. And you show that if the assertion

33
00:02:45.084 --> 00:02:49.095
holds for all smaller values, small
integers, then it also holds for the

34
00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:57.847
integer n. That is, you show that for
every positive integer N that's two or

35
00:02:57.847 --> 00:03:03.475
greater, you assume that P of K holds for
all K strictly less than N. And under that

36
00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:09.104
assumption, which is called the inductive
hypothesis. Under the assumption that P of

37
00:03:09.104 --> 00:03:14.460
K holds for all K strictly less than N,
you then establish that P of N holds as

38
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:23.021
well. So if you manage to complete both of
these steps, if you prove both the base

39
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:26.936
case that P(1) holds, you argue that
directly, and then also you argue that

40
00:03:26.936 --> 00:03:30.904
assuming the inductive hypothesis, that
the assertion holds for all smaller

41
00:03:30.904 --> 00:03:35.223
integers, it also holds for an arbitrary
integer n. Then you're done. Then in fact

42
00:03:35.223 --> 00:03:39.908
you have proven that the assertion P then
holds for every single positive integer N.

43
00:03:39.908 --> 00:03:44.258
Right? So for any given N that you care
about, the way you can derive that from

44
00:03:44.258 --> 00:03:48.664
one and two is you just start from the
base case, P of one holds. Then you apply

45
00:03:48.664 --> 00:03:53.071
the inductive step N minus one times. And
boom, you've got it. So you know that P

46
00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:57.086
holds for the integer N that you care
about as well. And that's true for

47
00:03:57.086 --> 00:04:05.912
arbitrarily large values of N. So those
are proofs by induction in general. Now

48
00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:10.673
let's instantiate this proof format, this
type of proof for establishing the

49
00:04:10.673 --> 00:04:19.788
correctness of quicksort. So let me write
again what is the assertion we care about.

50
00:04:19.788 --> 00:04:23.994
Our definition of P(n) is gonna be that
quicksort is always correct on arrays of

51
00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:31.866
length n. And of course what we want to
prove is that quicksort is correct no

52
00:04:31.866 --> 00:04:35.796
matter what size array that you give it,
that is, we want to prove that P(n) holds

53
00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:39.827
for every single n at least one. So this
is right in the wheelhouse of proofs by

54
00:04:39.827 --> 00:04:47.273
induction. ?Kay, so that's how we're going
to establish it. Now depending on the

55
00:04:47.273 --> 00:04:50.821
order in which you're watching the videos,
you may or may not have seen our

56
00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:54.559
discussion about how you actually choose
the pivot, recall that the first thing

57
00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:58.486
Quick Sort does is choose a pivot, then it
partitions the array around the pivot. So,

58
00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:02.412
we're going establish the correctness of
Quick Sort, no matter how the choose pivot

59
00:05:02.412 --> 00:05:06.055
sub-routine gets implemented. Okay, so now
matter how you choose pivots, you'll

60
00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:09.745
always have correctness. As we, as we'll
see in a different video, the choice of

61
00:05:09.745 --> 00:05:13.625
pivot definitely has an influence on the
running of Quick Sort, the correctness of

62
00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:21.531
Quick Sort, there's no matter how you
choose the pivot. So it's perceived by a

63
00:05:21.531 --> 00:05:28.689
proof by induction. So for the base case
when n equals one, this is a fairly

64
00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:33.047
trivial statement. Right? So, then we're
just talking about inputs that have only

65
00:05:33.047 --> 00:05:37.240
one element. Every such array is already
sorted. Quicksorts, in the bai, when n

66
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.764
equals one just returns the input array.
It doesn't do anything, and that is indeed

67
00:05:41.764 --> 00:05:49.641
the sort of array that it returns. So, by
the rather trivial argument we had

68
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:54.909
directly proven that p of one holds. We've
proven the rather unimpressive statement

69
00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:59.795
that quicksort always correctly sorts one
element arrays. Okay? No big deal. So,

70
00:05:59.795 --> 00:06:08.613
let's move on to the inductive step. So in
the inductive step we have to fix an

71
00:06:08.613 --> 00:06:13.617
arbitrary value of N that's at least two.
A value of N not covered by the base case.

72
00:06:13.617 --> 00:06:18.259
So let's fix some value of N, that leaves
two. Now what are we trying to prove?

73
00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:23.202
We're trying to prove that Quick Sort
always correctly sorts every input array

74
00:06:23.202 --> 00:06:30.872
of length N. So we also have to fix an
arbitrary such input. So let's make sure

75
00:06:30.872 --> 00:06:35.412
we're all clear on what it is we need to
show, what do you show in an inductive

76
00:06:35.412 --> 00:06:49.076
step. Assuming that PFK holds. For all
smaller values, all smaller integers, then

77
00:06:49.076 --> 00:07:00.654
P of N holds as well. And remember this is
the inductive hypothesis. So in the

78
00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:05.425
context of quicksort, we're assuming that
quicksort never makes a mistake on any

79
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:09.794
input array that has length strictly
smaller than n. And now we just have to

80
00:07:09.794 --> 00:07:17.341
show it never makes a mistake on array,
input arrays that have size exactly n. So

81
00:07:17.341 --> 00:07:21.548
this is the point in the proof where we
actually delve into how Quick Sort is

82
00:07:21.548 --> 00:07:25.701
implemented to argue correctness. So
recall what the first step of Quick Sort

83
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:29.745
is, it picks some pivot arbitrarily, we
don't know how, we don't care how. And

84
00:07:29.745 --> 00:07:35.506
then it partitions the array around this
pivot element p. Now as we argued in the

85
00:07:35.506 --> 00:07:40.186
video where we discussed the partition sub
routine, at the conclusion of that sub

86
00:07:40.186 --> 00:07:44.634
routine, the array has been rearranged
into the following format. The pipit is

87
00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:49.141
wherever it is, everything to the left of
the pipit is less than the pipit, and

88
00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:53.474
everything bigger than the pipit is
greater than the pipit. Alright, this is

89
00:07:53.474 --> 00:07:58.211
where how things stand at the conclusion
of the partitioning sub routine. So let's

90
00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:02.949
call this stuff less than the pipit the
first part of the partition array, and the

91
00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:09.827
stuff bigger than the pipit, the second
part of the partition array. And recall

92
00:08:09.827 --> 00:08:14.102
our observation from the overview video
that the pivot winds up in its correct

93
00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:18.484
position. Right, where would the pivot be?
Where is any element suppose to be in the

94
00:08:18.484 --> 00:08:22.759
final sorted array? What's suppose to be
to the right of everything less than it,

95
00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:26.767
and to the left of everything bigger than
it? And that's exactly where this

96
00:08:26.767 --> 00:08:34.083
partitioning subroutine deposits the pivot
element peak. So now to imply the

97
00:08:34.083 --> 00:08:38.464
inductive hypothesis, which you'll recall
is a hypothesis about how quick sort

98
00:08:38.464 --> 00:08:43.238
operates on smaller sub arrays. Let's call
the length of the first part in the second

99
00:08:43.238 --> 00:08:50.009
part of the partition [inaudible] K1 and
K2 respectively. Now, crucially, both k1

100
00:08:50.009 --> 00:08:55.552
and k2 are strictly less than n. Both of
these two parts have lengths strictly less

101
00:08:55.552 --> 00:09:00.829
than that of the given input array a.
That's because the pivot in particular is

102
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:06.038
excluded from both of those two parts. So,
their gonna have, at most n minus one

103
00:09:06.038 --> 00:09:12.002
[inaudible]. That means that we can apply
the inductive hypothesis, which says that

104
00:09:12.002 --> 00:09:16.179
the quicksort never makes a mistake on an
array that has size strictly less than n.

105
00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:20.306
That implies that our two recursive calls
to quickstart, the one to the first part

106
00:09:20.306 --> 00:09:24.534
and the one to the second part don't make
mistakes. They're guaranteed to sort those

107
00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:31.610
sub arrays correctly by the inductive
hypothesis. And to be very precise, what

108
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:37.450
we're using to argue that the [inaudible]
are correct, are P of K1 and P of K2. Or P

109
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:43.008
is the assertion that [inaudible] is
always correct on a [inaudible]. K1 and

110
00:09:43.008 --> 00:09:48.798
K2. And we know that both of these
statements are true because k1 and k2 are

111
00:09:48.798 --> 00:09:53.230
less th, are both less than n and because
of the inductive hypothesis. So what's the

112
00:09:53.230 --> 00:10:00.436
upshot? The upshot is, quicksort's gonna
be correct. And so the first recursive

113
00:10:00.436 --> 00:10:04.045
call puts all of the elements that are
less than the pivot in the correct

114
00:10:04.045 --> 00:10:07.848
relative order. Next comes the pivot,
which is bigger than all of that stuff in

115
00:10:07.848 --> 00:10:11.847
the first part and less than all the stuff
in the second part, and then the second

116
00:10:11.847 --> 00:10:16.138
recursive call correctly orders all of the
elements in the second part. So with those

117
00:10:16.138 --> 00:10:20.039
three things pasted together, we have a
sorted version of the input array and

118
00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:24.261
since this array was an arbitrary one, of
link N. That establishes the assertion P

119
00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:28.596
of N and since n was arbitrary, that
establishes the inductive and completes

120
00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:33.443
the proof of correctness of quick sort for
an arbitrary method of choosing the pivot

121
00:10:33.443 --> 00:10:36.900
element. [sound]
