00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.224
In the following series of videos, we'll
give a formal treatment of asymptotic

2
00:00:04.224 --> 00:00:08.777
notation, in particular big-Oh notation, as
well as work through a number of examples.

3
00:00:08.777 --> 00:00:13.331
Big-Oh notation concerns functions defined
on the positive integers, we'll call it T(n)

4
00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:17.720
We'll pretty much always have the
same semantics for T(n). We're gonna be

5
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.164
concerned about the worst-case running
time of an algorithm, as a function of the

6
00:00:22.164 --> 00:00:26.443
input size, n. So, the question I wanna
answer for you in the rest of this video,

7
00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:30.448
is, what does it mean when we say a
function, T(n), is big-Oh of f(n). Or

8
00:00:30.448 --> 00:00:34.760
hear f(n) is some basic function, like
for example n log n. So I'll give you a

9
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.059
number of answers, a number of ways of, to
think about what big-Oh notation really

10
00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.358
means. For starters let's begin with an
English definition. What does it mean for

11
00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:47.656
a function to be big-Oh of f(n)? It means
eventually, for all sufficiently large

12
00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:51.740
values of n, it's bounded above by a
constant multiple of f(n). Let's think

13
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.838
about it in a couple other ways. So next
I'm gonna translate this English

14
00:00:55.838 --> 00:01:00.363
definition into picture and then I'll
translate it into formal mathematics. So

15
00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:05.119
pictorially you can imagine that perhaps
we have T(n) denoted by this blue

16
00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.640
functions here. And perhaps f(n) is
denoted by this green function here, which

17
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.309
lies below T(n). But when we double f(n), we get a function that eventually

18
00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:21.599
crosses T(n) and forevermore is larger
than it. So in this event, we would say

19
00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:26.384
that T(n) indeed is a Big-Oh of f(n).
The reason being that for all sufficiently

20
00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:30.765
large n, and once we go far enough out right
on this graph, indeed, a constant

21
00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:35.319
multiple times of f(n), twice f(n), is an upper bound of T(n).

22
00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.873
So finally, let me give you a actual
mathematical definition that you could use

23
00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:44.542
to do formal proofs. So how do we say, in
mathematics, that eventually it should be

24
00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:49.132
bounded above by a constant multiple of f(n)? We see that there exists two

25
00:01:49.132 --> 00:01:55.997
constants, which I'll call c and n0. So
that T(n) is no more than c times f(n)

26
00:01:55.997 --> 00:02:02.633
for all n that exceed or equal n0.
So, the role of these two constants is to

27
00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:07.320
quantify what we mean by a constant
multiple, and what we mean by sufficiently

28
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.948
large, in the English definition. c
obviously quantifies the constant multiple

29
00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:16.515
of f(n), and n0 is quantifying
sufficiently large, that's the threshold

30
00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:21.322
beyond which we insist that, c times f(n) is an upper-bound on T(n). So, going

31
00:02:21.322 --> 00:02:25.889
back to the picture, what are c and n0? Well, c, of course, is just going to

32
00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:30.801
be two. And n0 is the crossing point.
So we get to where two f(n). And T(n)

33
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:35.696
cross, and then we drop the acentode.
This would be the relative value of n0

34
00:02:35.696 --> 00:02:39.324
in this picture, so that's the formal
definition, the way to prove that

35
00:02:39.324 --> 00:02:43.471
something's bigger of f(n) you
exhibit these two constants c and n0

36
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:47.617
and it better be the case that for all n at least
n0, c times f(n) upper-bounds T(n).

37
00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:51.919
One way to think about it if you're trying
to establish that something is big-Oh of

38
00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:56.169
some function it's like you're playing a
game against an opponent and you want to

39
00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.421
prove that. This inequality here holds and
your opponent must show that it doesn't

40
00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:04.829
hold for sufficiently large n you have to
go first your job is to pick a strategy in

41
00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.133
the form of a constant c and a constant n0 and your opponent is then allowed to

42
00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:13.592
pick any number n larger than n0 so the
function is big-Oh of f(n) if and only if you

43
00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:17.896
have a winning strategy in this game. If
you can up front commit to constants c and

44
00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:22.149
n0 so that no matter how big of an n
your opponent picks, this inequality holds

45
00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:26.504
if you have no winning strategy then it's
not big-Oh of f(n) no matter what C and n0

46
00:03:26.504 --> 00:03:30.796
you choose your opponent can always
flip this in equality. By choosing a

47
00:03:30.796 --> 00:03:36.392
suitable, suitable large value of n. I
want to emphasis one last thing which is

48
00:03:36.392 --> 00:03:41.365
that these constants, what do I mean by
constants. I mean they are independent of

49
00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:45.382
n. And so when you apply this definition,
and you choose your constant c and

50
00:03:45.382 --> 00:03:49.179
n0, it better be that n does not appear
anywhere. So C should just be something

51
00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:52.784
like a thousand or a million. Some
constant independent of n. So those are a

52
00:03:52.784 --> 00:03:56.533
bunch of way to think about big-Oh
notation. In English, you wanna have it

53
00:03:56.533 --> 00:04:00.522
bound above for sufficiently large numbers
n. I'm showing you how to translate that

54
00:04:00.522 --> 00:04:04.463
into mathematics that give you a pictorial
representation. And also sort of a game

55
00:04:04.463 --> 00:04:08.163
theoretic way to think about it. Now,
let's move on to a video that explores a

56
00:04:08.163 --> 00:04:09.077
number of examples.
